<TITLE>BAHIA
 COCOA
 REVIEW</TITLE>
<BODY>Showers
 continued
 throughout
 the
 week
 in
the
 Bahia
 cocoa
 zone,
 alleviating
 the
 drought
 since
 early
January
 and
 improving
 prospects
 for
 the
 coming
 temporao,
although
 normal
 humidity
 levels
 have
 not
 been
 restored,
Comissaria
 Smith
 said
 in
 its
 weekly
 review.

 
 
 
 The
 dry
 period
 means
 the
 temporao
 will
 be
 late
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 Arrivals
 for
 the
 week
 ended
 February
 22
 were
 155,221
 bags
of
 60
 kilos
 making
 a
 cumulative
 total
 for
 the
 season
 of
 5.93
mln
 against
 5.81
 at
 the
 same
 stage
 last
 year.
 Again
 it
 seems
that
 cocoa
 delivered
 earlier
 on
 consignment
 was
 included
 in
 the
arrivals
 figures.

 
 
 
 Comissaria
 Smith
 said
 there
 is
 still
 some
 doubt
 as
 to
 how
much
 old
 crop
 cocoa
 is
 still
 available
 as
 harvesting
 has
practically
 come
 to
 an
 end.
 With
 total
 Bahia
 crop
 estimates
around
 6.4
 mln
 bags
 and
 sales
 standing
 at
 almost
 6.2
 mln
 there
are
 a
 few
 hundred
 thousand
 bags
 still
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 farmers,
middlemen,
 exporters
 and
 processors.

 
 
 
 There
 are
 doubts
 as
 to
 how
 much
 of
 this
 cocoa
 would
 be
 fit
for
 export
 as
 shippers
 are
 now
 experiencing
 dificulties
 in
obtaining
 +Bahia
 superior+
 certificates.

 
 
 
 In
 view
 of
 the
 lower
 quality
 over
 recent
 weeks
 farmers
 have
sold
 a
 good
 part
 of
 their
 cocoa
 held
 on
 consignment.

 
 
 
 Comissaria
 Smith
 said
 spot
 bean
 prices
 rose
 to
 340
 to
 350
cruzados
 per
 arroba
 of
 15
 kilos.

 
 
 
 Bean
 shippers
 were
 reluctant
 to
 offer
 nearby
 shipment
 and
only
 limited
 sales
 were
 booked
 for
 March
 shipment
 at
 1,750
 to
1,780
 dlrs
 per
 tonne
 to
 ports
 to
 be
 named.

 
 
 
 New
 crop
 sales
 were
 also
 light
 and
 all
 to
 open
 ports
 with
June/July
 going
 at
 1,850
 and
 1,880
 dlrs
 and
 at
 35

under
 New
 York
 july,
 Aug/Sept
 at
 1,870,
 1,875
 and
 1,880
 dlrs
per
 tonne
 FOB.

 
 
 
 Routine
 sales
 of
 butter
 were
 made.
 March/April
 sold
 at
4,340,
 4,345
 and
 4,350
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 April/May
 butter
 went
 at
 2.27
 times
 New

 May,
 June/July
at
 4,400

 4,415

 Sept
 and

 Comissaria
 Smith
 said.

 
 
 
 Destinations
 were
 the
 U.S.,
 Covertible
 currency
 areas,
Uruguay
 and
 open
 ports.

 
 
 
 Cake
 sales
 were
 registered
 at
 785
 to
 995

 Buyers
 were
 the
 U.S.,
 Argentina,
 Uruguay
 and
 convertible
currency
 areas.

 
 
 
 Liquor
 sales
 were
 limited
 with
 March/April
 selling
 at
 2,325
and
 2,380
 dlrs,
 June/July
 at
 2,375

 New

Sept
 and
 Oct/Dec
 at

 times
 New

 Dec,
 Comissaria
 Smith
said.

 
 
 
 Total
 Bahia
 sales
 are
 currently
 estimated
 at
 6.13
 mln
 bags
against
 the
 1986/87
 crop
 and
 1.06
 mln

 against
 the
 1987/88
crop.

 
 
 
 Final
 figures
 for
 the
 period
 to
 February

 are
 expected
 to
be
 published
 by
 the
 Brazilian

 Trade
 Commission
 after

<TITLE>TALKING
 POINT/BANKAMERICA
 &lt;BAC>
 EQUITY
 OFFER</TITLE>
<BODY>BankAmerica
 Corp
 is
 not
 under
pressure
 to
 act
 quickly
 on
 its
 proposed
 equity
 offering
 and
would
 do
 well
 to
 delay
 it
 because
 of
 the
 stock's
 recent
 poor
performance,
 banking
 analysts
 said.

 
 
 
 Some
 analysts
 said
 they
 have
 recommended
 BankAmerica
 delay
its
 up
 to
 one-billion-dlr
 equity
 offering,
 which
 has
 yet
 to
 be
approved
 by
 the
 Securities
 and
 Exchange
 Commission.

 
 
 
 BankAmerica
 stock
 fell
 this
 week,
 along
 with
 other
 banking
issues,
 on
 the
 news
 that
 Brazil
 has
 suspended
 interest
 payments
on
 a
 large
 portion
 of
 its
 foreign
 debt.

 
 
 
 The
 stock
 traded
 around
 12,
 down
 1/8,
 this
 afternoon,
after
 falling
 to
 11-1/2
 earlier
 this
 week
 on
 the
 news.

 
 
 
 Banking
 analysts
 said
 that
 with
 the
 immediate
 threat
 of
 the
First
 Interstate
 Bancorp
 &lt;I>
 takeover
 bid
 gone,
 BankAmerica
 is
under
 no
 pressure
 to
 sell
 the
 securities
 into
 a
 market
 that
will
 be
 nervous
 on
 bank
 stocks
 in
 the
 near
 term.

 
 
 
 BankAmerica
 filed
 the
 offer
 on
 January
 26.
 It
 was
 seen
 as
one
 of
 the
 major
 factors
 leading
 the
 First
 Interstate
withdrawing
 its
 takeover
 bid
 on
 February
 9.

 
 
 
 A
 BankAmerica
 spokesman
 said
 SEC
 approval
 is
 taking
 longer
than
 expected
 and
 market
 conditions
 must
 now
 be
 re-evaluated.

 
 
 
 "The
 circumstances
 at
 the
 time
 will
 determine
 what
 we
 do,"
said
 Arthur
 Miller,
 BankAmerica's
 Vice
 President
 for
 Financial
Communications,
 when
 asked
 if
 BankAmerica
 would
 proceed
 with
the
 offer
 immediately
 after
 it
 receives
 SEC
 approval.

 
 
 
 "I'd
 put
 it
 off
 as
 long
 as
 they
 conceivably
 could,"
 said
Lawrence
 Cohn,
 analyst
 with
 Merrill
 Lynch,
 Pierce,
 Fenner
 and
Smith.

 
 
 
 Cohn
 said
 the
 longer
 BankAmerica
 waits,
 the
 longer
 they
have
 to
 show
 the
 market
 an
 improved
 financial
 outlook.

 
 
 
 Although
 BankAmerica
 has
 yet
 to
 specify
 the
 types
 of
equities
 it
 would
 offer,
 most
 analysts
 believed
 a
 convertible
preferred
 stock
 would
 encompass
 at
 least
 part
 of
 it.

 
 
 
 Such
 an
 offering
 at
 a
 depressed
 stock
 price
 would
 mean
 a
lower
 conversion
 price
 and
 more
 dilution
 to
 BankAmerica
 stock
holders,
 noted
 Daniel
 Williams,
 analyst
 with
 Sutro
 Group.

 
 
 
 Several
 analysts
 said
 that
 while
 they
 believe
 the
 Brazilian
debt
 problem
 will
 continue
 to
 hang
 over
 the
 banking
 industry
through
 the
 quarter,
 the
 initial
 shock
 reaction
 is
 likely
 to
ease
 over
 the
 coming
 weeks.

 
 
 
 Nevertheless,
 BankAmerica,
 which
 holds
 about
 2.70
 billion
dlrs
 in
 Brazilian
 loans,
 stands
 to
 lose
 15-20
 mln
 dlrs
 if
 the
interest
 rate
 is
 reduced
 on
 the
 debt,
 and
 as
 much
 as
 200
 mln
dlrs
 if
 Brazil
 pays
 no
 interest
 for
 a
 year,
 said
 Joseph
Arsenio,
 analyst
 with
 Birr,
 Wilson
 and
 Co.

 
 
 
 He
 noted,
 however,
 that
 any
 potential
 losses
 would
 not
 show
up
 in
 the
 current
 quarter.

 
 
 
 With
 other
 major
 banks
 standing
 to
 lose
 even
 more
 than
BankAmerica
 if
 Brazil
 fails
 to
 service
 its
 debt,
 the
 analysts
said
 they
 expect
 the
 debt
 will
 be
 restructured,
 similar
 to
 way
Mexico's
 debt
 was,
 minimizing
 losses
 to
 the
 creditor
 banks.

 its

 28,
 profits
 may
 be
 below
 the
 2.4
 mln
dlrs,
 or
 15
 cts
 a
 share,
 earned
 in
 the
 first
 quarter
 of

1986.

 
 
 
 The
 company
 said
 any

 would
 be
 due
 to
 expenses
related
 to
 the
 acquisitions
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 current
quarter
 of
 seven
 licensees
 of
 Sealy
 Inc,
 as
 well
 as
 82
 pct
 of
the
 outstanding
 capital
 stock
 of
 Sealy.

 
 
 
 Because
 of
 these
 acquisitions,
 it
 said,
 first

 sales
will
 be
 substantially
 higher
 than
 last

 67.1

 Noting
 that
 it
 typically
 reports

 in

 said
 the
 report
 is
 likely
 to
 be
 issued
 in

 this

 It
 said
 the
 delay
 is
 due
 to

 &lt;BAC></TITLE>
<BODY>BankAmerica
 Corp
 is
 not
 under
pressure
 to
 act
 quickly
 on
 its
 proposed
 equity
 offering
 and
would
 do
 well
 to
 delay
 it
 because
 of
 the
 stock's
 recent
 poor
performance,
 banking
 analysts
 said.

 
 
 
 Some
 analysts
 said
 they
 have
 recommended
 BankAmerica
 delay
its
 up
 to
 one-billion-dlr
 equity
 offering,
 which
 has
 yet
 to
 be
approved
 by
 the
 Securities
 and
 Exchange
 Commission.

 
 
 
 BankAmerica
 stock
 fell
 this
 week,
 along
 with
 other
 banking
issues,
 on
 the
 news
 that
 Brazil
 has
 suspended
 interest
 payments
on
 a
 large
 portion
 of
 its
 foreign
 debt.

 
 
 
 The
 stock
 traded
 around
 12,
 down
 1/8,
 this
 afternoon,
after
 falling
 to
 11-1/2
 earlier
 this
 week
 on
 the
 news.

 
 
 
 Banking
 analysts
 said
 that
 with
 the
 immediate
 threat
 of
 the
First
 Interstate
 Bancorp
 &lt;I>
 takeover
 bid
 gone,
 BankAmerica
 is
under
 no
 pressure
 to
 sell
 the
 securities
 into
 a
 market
 that
will
 be
 nervous
 on
 bank
 stocks
 in
 the
 near
 term.

 
 
 
 BankAmerica
 filed
 the
 offer
 on
 January
 26.
 It
 was
 seen
 as
one
 of
 the
 major
 factors
 leading
 the
 First
 Interstate
withdrawing
 its
 takeover
 bid
 on
 February
 9.

 
 
 
 A
 BankAmerica
 spokesman
 said
 SEC
 approval
 is
 taking
 longer
than
 expected
 and
 market
 conditions
 must
 now
 be
 re-evaluated.

 
 
 
 "The
 circumstances
 at
 the
 time
 will
 determine
 what
 we
 do,"
said
 Arthur
 Miller,
 BankAmerica's
 Vice
 President
 for
 Financial
Communications,
 when
 asked
 if
 BankAmerica
 would
 proceed
 with
the
 offer
 immediately
 after
 it
 receives
 SEC
 approval.

 
 
 
 "I'd
 put
 it
 off
 as
 long
 as
 they
 conceivably
 could,"
 said
Lawrence
 Cohn,
 analyst
 with
 Merrill
 Lynch,
 Pierce,
 Fenner
 and
Smith.

 
 
 
 Cohn
 said
 the
 longer
 BankAmerica
 waits,
 the
 longer
 they
have
 to
 show
 the
 market
 an
 improved
 financial
 outlook.

 
 
 
 Although
 BankAmerica
 has
 yet
 to
 specify
 the
 types
 of
equities
 it
 would
 offer,
 most
 analysts
 believed
 a
 convertible
preferred
 stock
 would
 encompass
 at
 least
 part
 of
 it.

 
 
 
 Such
 an
 offering
 at
 a
 depressed
 stock
 price
 would
 mean
 a
lower
 conversion
 price
 and
 more
 dilution
 to
 BankAmerica
 stock
holders,
 noted
 Daniel
 Williams,
 analyst
 with
 Sutro
 Group.

 
 
 
 Several
 analysts
 said
 that
 while
 they
 believe
 the
 Brazilian
debt
 problem
 will
 continue
 to
 hang
 over
 the
 banking
 industry
through
 the
 quarter,
 the
 initial
 shock
 reaction
 is
 likely
 to
ease
 over
 the
 coming
 weeks.

 
 
 
 Nevertheless,
 BankAmerica,
 which
 holds
 about
 2.70
 billion
dlrs
 in
 Brazilian
 loans,
 stands
 to
 lose
 15-20
 mln
 dlrs
 if
 the
interest
 rate
 is
 reduced
 on
 the
 debt,
 and
 as
 much
 as
 200
 mln
dlrs
 if
 Brazil
 pays
 no
 interest
 for
 a
 year,
 said
 Joseph
Arsenio,
 analyst
 with
 Birr,
 Wilson
 and
 Co.

 
 
 
 He
 noted,
 however,
 that
 any
 potential
 losses
 would
 not
 show
up
 in
 the
 current
 quarter.

 
 
 
 With
 other
 major
 banks
 standing
 to
 lose
 even
 more
 than
BankAmerica
 if
 Brazil
 fails
 to
 service
 its
 debt,
 the
 analysts
said
 they
 expect
 the
 debt
 will
 be
 restructured,
 similar
 to
 way
Mexico's
 debt
 was,
 minimizing
 losses
 to
 the
 creditor
 banks.

 expects
 earnings
 for
 the
fourth
 quarter
 ending
 May

 to
 exceed
 those
 of
 the
 same
year-ago
 period,
 Chairman
 Kenneth
 Douglas
 told
 analysts.

 
 
 
 In
 the
 fiscal
 1986
 fourth
 quarter
 the
 food
 processor
reported
 earnings
 of
 40
 cts
 a
 share.

 
 
 
 Douglas
 also
 said
 the
 year's
 sales
 should
 exceed
 1.4
billion
 dlrs,
 up
 from
 1.27
 billion
 dlrs
 the
 prior
 year.

 
 
 
 He
 repeated
 an
 earlier
 projection
 that
 third-quarter
earnings
 "will
 probably
 be
 off
 slightly"
 from
 last
 year's
 40
cts
 a
 share,
 falling
 in
 the
 range
 of
 34
 cts
 to
 36
 cts
 a
 share.

 
 
 
 Douglas
 said
 it
 was
 too
 early
 to
 project
 whether
 the
anticipated
 fourth
 quarter
 performance
 would
 be
 "enough
 for
 us
to
 exceed
 the
 prior
 year's
 overall
 earnings"
 of
 1.53
 dlrs
 a
share.

 
 
 
 In
 1988,
 Douglas
 said
 Dean
 should
 experience
 "a
 20
 pct
improvement
 in
 our
 bottom
 line
 from
 effects
 of
 the
 tax
 reform
act
 alone."

 
 
 
 President
 Howard
 Dean
 said
 in
 fiscal
 1988
 the
 company
 will
derive
 
 benefits
 of
 various
 dairy
 and
 frozen
 vegetable
acquisitions
 from
 Ryan
 Milk
 to
 the
 Larsen
 Co.

 
 
 
 Dean
 also
 said
 the
 company
 will
 benefit
 from
 its
acquisition
 in
 late
 December
 of
 Elgin
 Blenders
 Inc,
 West
Chicago.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 the
 company
 is
 a
 major
 shareholder
 of
 E.B.I.
 Foods
Ltd,
 a
 United
 Kingdom
 blender,
 and
 has
 licensing
 arrangements
in
 Australia,

 and
 Japan.

 
 
 
 "It

 said.

 
 
 
 The
 interest
 rate
 on
 the
 rescheduling
 was
 originally
 set
 at
1-1/8
 pct
 over
 Eurodollar
 rates,
 but
 Venezuela
 requested
 easier
terms
 because
 of
 a
 40
 pct
 drop
 in
 oil
 income
 last
 year.

 
 
 
 It
 also
 asked
 for
 a
 reduction
 in
 the
 repayments
 it
 was
 due
to
 make
 in
 1987,
 1988
 and
 1989
 -
 after
 an
 earlier
 request
 that
it
 make
 no
 amortizations
 at
 all
 in
 those
 years
 was
 rebuffed
 -
and
 sought
 a
 commitment
 from
 the
 banks
 to
 finance
 new
investment
 in
 Venezuela.

 
 
 
 The
 breakthrough
 in
 the
 Venezuelan
 talks,
 which
 have
 been
going
 on
 intermittently
 for
 several
 months,
 follows
 the
announcement
 earlier
 today
 of
 a
 10.6
 billion
 dlr
 debt
rescheduling
 pact
 between
 Chile
 and
 its
 bank
 advisory
 panel.

 
 
 
 And
 last
 night
 Citibank
 said
 Mexico's
 financing
 package,
including
 a
 7.7
 billion
 dlr
 loan,
 will
 be
 signed
 on
 March
 20.

 
 
 
 While
 the
 sudden
 progress
 is
 to
 some
 extent
 coincidental,
bankers
 acknowledge
 a
 desire
 to
 chalk
 up
 some
 quick
 successes
after
 the
 shock
 of
 Brazil's
 unilateral
 interest
 suspension
 last
Friday.
 By
 striking
 swift
 deals,
 banks
 hope
 to
 reduce
 the
incentive
 for
 other
 debtors
 to
 emulate
 Brazil.

<TITLE>TOWER
 REPORT
 DIMINISHES
 REAGAN'S
 HOPES
 OF
 REBOUND</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 Tower
 Commission
 report,
 which
says
 President
 Reagan
 was
 ignorant
 about
 much
 of
 the
 Iran
 arms
deal,
 just
 about
 ends
 his
 prospects
 of
 regaining
 political
dominance
 in
 Washington,
 political
 analysts
 said.

 
 
 
 "This
 is
 certification
 of
 incompetence,"
 private
 political
analyst
 Stephen
 Hess
 told
 Reuters
 in
 commenting
 on
 the
 Tower
report
 made
 public
 today.

 
 
 
 "It's
 as
 if
 he
 went
 before
 a
 professional
 licensing
 board
and
 was
 denied
 credentials."

 
 
 
 In
 one
 of
 the
 most
 direct
 criticisms,
 board
 chairman
 John
Tower,
 a
 longtime
 Reagan
 supporter
 and
 former
 Republican
senator
 from
 Texas,
 told
 a
 press
 conference,
 "The
 president
clearly
 did
 not
 understand
 the
 nature
 of
 this
 operation."

 
 
 
 The
 report,
 which
 lent
 credence
 to
 widespread
 opinion
 in
Washington
 that
 Reagan
 is
 not
 in
 full
 command
 of
 the
government,
 was
 particularly
 damaging
 because
 it
 was
 prepared
by
 a
 board
 of
 the
 Republican
 president's
 own
 choosing.

 
 
 
 The
 three-member
 panel
 made
 up
 of
 Tower,
 former
 National
Security
 Adviser
 Brent
 Scowcroft
 and
 former
 Secretary
 of
 State
Edmund
 Muskie,
 does
 not
 carry
 the
 partisan
 taint
 of
 criticism
from
 a
 Congress
 controlled
 by
 the
 Democratic
 party.

 
 
 
 "We're
 falling
 by
 our
 own
 hand,"
 said
 one
 Republican
political
 strategist.
 "What
 can
 we
 say
 except
 'we're
 sorry,
 we
won't
 do
 it
 again'?"

 
 
 
 The
 strategist,
 who
 works
 for
 one
 of
 his
 party's
 top
 1988
presidential
 contenders
 and
 asked
 not
 to
 be
 identified,
 said
the
 report
 was
 like
 "an
 anvil
 falling
 on
 us."

 
 
 
 Hess,
 with
 the
 Brookings
 Institution
 public
 policy
 study
group,
 said
 the
 report
 is
 the
 final
 blow
 to
 Reagan's
 hopes
 of
regaining
 the
 upper
 hand
 he
 once
 had
 in
 dealings
 with
 Congress,
the
 press
 and
 the
 Washington
 bureaucracy.

 
 
 
 The
 report
 may
 also
 undermine
 the
 standing
 of
 Defense
Secretary
 Caspar
 Weinberger
 and
 Secretary
 of
 State
 George
Shultz,
 who
 the
 report
 suggests
 were
 more
 interested
 in
 keeping
their
 own
 skirts
 clean
 than
 supporting
 the
 president.

 
 
 
 "They
 protected
 the
 record
 as
 to
 their
 own
 positions
 on
 this
issue.
 They
 were
 not
 energetic
 in
 attempting
 to
 protect
 the
president
 from
 the
 consequences,"
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 White
 House
 chief
 of
 staff
 Donald
 Regan
 and
 former
 Central
Intelligence
 Agency
 Director
 William
 Casey
 also
 received
 strong
criticism,
 but
 the
 blows
 were
 expected
 in
 their
 cases.

 
 
 
 Regan,
 expected
 to
 resign
 or
 be
 fired
 shortly,
 was
 savaged
for
 allegedly
 failing
 both
 to
 help
 Reagan
 conduct
 the
 Iran
initiative
 and
 to
 avoid
 "chaos"
 in
 the
 disclosure
 process.

 
 
 
 Casey,
 who
 underwent
 surgery
 for
 removal
 of
 a
 cancerous
brain
 tumor
 in
 December,
 had
 already
 resigned
 for
 health
reasons
 last
 month.

 
 
 
 "This
 is
 a
 story
 about
 people
 who
 came
 up
 somewhat
 short
 of
being
 heroes,"
 Tower
 told
 reporters.

 
 
 
 While
 Reagan
 retains
 considerable
 constitutional
 powers,
including
 command
 of
 the
 armed
 forces
 and
 the
 right
 to
 veto
legislation,
 analysts
 say
 it
 will
 be
 difficult
 for
 him
 to
retake
 control
 of
 the
 country's
 policy
 agenda
 --
 particularly
with
 Congress
 controlled
 by
 the
 Democrats.

 
 
 
 The
 crucial
 remaining
 question,
 they
 said,
 is
 whether
 the
man
 in
 the
 street
 will
 forsake
 Reagan
 over
 the
 affair.

 
 
 
 Although
 his
 job
 approval
 rating
 has
 fallen
 as
 much
 as
twenty
 percentage
 points
 in
 some
 opinion
 polls
 since
 the
 arms
deal
 with
 Iran
 became
 public
 last
 November,
 his
 personal
popularity
 is
 still
 relatively
 high.

 
 
 
 A
 Los
 Angeles
 Times
 poll
 released
 earlier
 this
 week
 showed
that
 just
 37
 pct
 of
 those
 surveyed
 thought
 Reagan
 was
 in
control
 of
 the
 government,
 but
 55
 pct
 still
 thought
 he
 was
doing
 a
 good
 job
 as
 president.

 
 
 
 American
 Enterprise
 Institute
 analyst
 William
 Schneider,
 a
Democrat,
 says
 Reagan's
 loss
 of
 support
 among
 Washington
 power
brokers
 could
 be
 offset
 by
 continued
 backing
 of
 the
 public.

 
 
 
 "In
 the
 past,
 he
 has
 been
 able
 to
 go
 around
 the
 power
 elite
by
 appealing
 directly
 to
 the
 public,"
 Schneider
 said.

 
 
 
 Reagan
 will
 again
 plead
 his
 case
 that
 way
 in
 a
 televised
address
 next
 week.

 
 
 
 But
 one
 top
 Republican
 strategist
 warned
 against
 expecting
a
 dramatic
 turnaround.

 
 
 
 "The
 White
 House
 has
 to
 avoid
 building
 expectations
 that
cannot
 be
 met,"
 said
 the
 strategist,
 who
 requested
 anonymity.
"They
 have
 to
 recognize
 there
 is
 no
 quick
 fix."

 
 
 
 Analysts
 also
 point
 out
 that
 Reagan's
 personal
 popularity
has
 not
 always
 translated
 into
 public
 backing
 for
 his
 policies.

 
 
 
 They
 note
 he
 was
 dramatically
 rebuffed
 in
 last
 November's
elections
 when
 voters
 rejected
 his
 appeals
 and
 restored
 control
of
 the
 Senate
 to
 the
 Democrats.

 LICENSING
 REFORM
 BILL</TITLE>
<BODY>Sens.
 Alan
 Cranston
 (D-Cal.)
 and
Daniel
 Evans
 (R-Wash.)
 said
 they
 introduced
 export
 licensing
reform
 legislation
 that
 could
 save
 U.S.
 companies
 hundreds
 of
thousands
 of
 dollars
 annually.

 
 
 
 "Our
 emphasis
 is
 two-fold:
 Decontrol
 and
 de-license
 items
where
 such
 actions
 will
 not
 endanger
 our
 national
 security,
 and
eliminate
 the
 Department
 of
 Defense's
 de
 facto
 veto
 authority
over
 the
 licensing
 process,"
 Cranston
 said.

 
 
 
 "Our
 reforms
 should
 reduce
 licensing
 requirements
 by
 65
 
 to
70
 pct,"
 he
 told
 reporters.
 "I
 am
 convinced
 that
 a
 more
rational...licensing
 process
 will
 boost
 exports."

 
 
 
 U.S.
 export
 controls
 are
 intended
 to
 deny
 Eastern
 bloc
countries
 access
 to
 technology
 that
 could
 further
 their
military
 capabilities.

 
 
 
 "By
 refocusing
 our
 control
 resources
 on
 higher
 levels
 of
technology,
 technology
 that
 is
 truly
 critical,
 we
 will
 do
 a
better
 job
 of
 preventing
 diversion
 of
 critical
 technology
 to
our
 adversaries
 while
 promoting
 more
 exports,"
 Cranston
 said.

 
 
 
 "We
 cannot
 expect
 to
 continue
 to
 play
 a
 leading
 role
 in
 new
technology
 development
 in
 the
 future
 if
 we

<BODY>inflation
plan,
 initially
 hailed
 at
 home
 and
 abroad
 as
 the
 saviour
 of
 the
economy,
 is
 limping
 towards
 its
 first
 anniversary
 amid
 soaring
prices,
 widespread
 shortages
 and
 a
 foreign
 payments
 crisis.

 
 
 
 Announced
 last
 February
 28
 the
 plan
 froze
 prices,
 fixed
 the
value
 of
 the
 new
 Cruzado
 currency
 and
 ended
 widespread
indexation
 of
 the
 economy
 in
 a
 bid
 to
 halt
 the
 country's
 250
pct
 inflation
 rate.

 
 
 
 But
 within
 a
 year
 the
 plan
 has
 all
 but
 collapsed.

 
 
 
 "The
 situation
 now
 is
 worse
 than
 it
 was.
 Although
 there
 was
inflation,
 at
 least
 the
 economy
 worked,"
 a
 leading
 bank
economist
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 crumbling
 of
 the
 plan
 has
 been
 accompanied
 by
 a
dramatic
 reversal
 in
 the
 foreign
 trade
 account.
 In
 1984
 and
1985
 Brazil's
 annual
 trade
 surpluses
 had
 been
 sufficient
 to
cover
 the
 12
 billion
 dlrs
 needed
 to
 service
 its
 109
 billion
 dlr
foreign

 For
 the
 first
 nine
 months
 of
 1986
 all
 seemed
 to
 be
 on
target
 for
 a
 repeat,
 with
 monthly
 surpluses
 averaging
 one
billion
 dlrs.
 But
 as
 exports
 were
 diverted
 and
 imports
increased
 to
 avoid
 further
 domestic
 shortages
 the
 trade
 surplus
plunged
 to
 211
 mln
 dlrs
 in
 October
 and
 since
 then
 has
 averaged
under
 150

 DATA
 POINT
 TO
 CAPITAL
 SPENDING
 SLOWDOWN</TITLE>
<BODY>A
 surprise
 7.5
 pct
 drop
 in
 U.S.
 January
durable
 goods
 orders
 points
 to
 a
 slowdown
 in
 capital
 spending
that
 could
 presage
 lackluster
 real
 growth
 in
 the
 U.S.
 economy
in
 the
 first
 quarter
 of
 1987,
 economists
 said.

 
 
 
 With
 total
 orders,
 excluding
 the
 volatile
 defense
 sector,
falling
 a
 record
 9.9
 pct,
 economists
 agreed
 that
 the
 report
painted
 a
 bleak
 picture
 for
 the
 U.S.
 economy.

 
 
 
 But
 they
 stressed
 that
 the
 1987
 tax
 reform
 laws
 may
 be
 a
primary
 factor
 behind
 the
 drop
 in
 orders
 for
 business
 capital
investment.

 
 
 
 "It's
 a
 rather
 gloomy
 outlook
 for
 the
 economy,
 said
 David
Wyss
 of
 Data
 Resources
 Inc.
 "I'm
 particularly
 impressed
 by
 the
19.7
 pct
 drop
 in
 non-defense
 capital
 goods
 orders
 because
 it
may
 be
 a
 sign
 that
 businesses
 are
 reacting
 more
 adversely
 to
tax
 reform
 than
 we
 thought."

 
 
 
 The
 Commerce
 Department
 pointed
 out
 that
 a
 record
 14.8
 pct
decline
 in
 new
 orders
 for
 machinery
 was
 led
 by
 declines
 in
office
 and
 computing
 equipment
 orders.

 
 
 
 Economists
 said
 the
 drop
 in
 computer
 orders
 may
 have
 been
 a
response
 to
 the
 lengthening
 of
 depreciation
 schedules
 and
 the
end
 of
 the
 investment
 tax
 credit
 under
 the
 new
 tax
 laws.

 
 
 
 "It's
 more
 expensive
 to
 invest
 than
 it
 used
 to
 be,
 so
people
 just
 aren't
 doing
 it
 as
 much,"
 Wyss
 said.

 
 
 
 
 Increases
 in
 durable
 goods
 orders
 at
 year's
 end
 reinforced
the
 view
 that
 businesses
 anticipated
 the
 changing
 tax
 laws,
economists
 said.

 
 
 
 November
 durable
 goods
 orders
 rose
 5.1
 pct
 and
 December's
increased
 1.5
 pct,
 revised
 upwards
 from
 a
 previously
 reported
0.9
 pct.

 
 
 
 But
 most
 acknowledged
 that
 the
 huge
 January
 drop
 was
 caused
by
 more
 than
 tax
 reform.

 
 
 
 "The
 wash-out
 that
 took
 place
 in
 January
 was
 far
 greater
than
 the
 actual
 gains
 that
 took
 place
 in
 November
 and
December,"
 said
 Bill
 Sullivan
 of
 Dean
 Witter
 Reynolds
 Inc.
 "The
economy
 has
 a
 weakening
 bent
 to
 it
 early
 in
 the
 year."

 
 
 
 "The
 report
 definitely
 points
 to
 very
 sluggish
 capital
spending
 over
 the
 next
 couple
 of
 quarters,"
 said
 Donald
 Maude
of
 Midland
 Montagu
 Capital
 Markets
 Inc.

 
 
 
 Maude
 pointed
 to
 a
 continuing
 decline
 in
 order
 backlogs
 as
evidence
 that
 the
 outlook
 for
 new
 orders
 is
 not
 improving.
 In
November,
 order
 backlogs
 rose
 0.6
 pct,
 but
 in
 December
 they
fell
 0.6
 pct
 and
 in
 January
 0.7
 pct,
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 "It
 suggests
 orders
 in
 the
 pipeline
 are
 depleting,
 which
may
 quickly
 translate
 to
 a
 drop
 in
 production,"
 Midland
Montagu's
 Maude
 said.

 
 
 
 Wyss
 cautioned
 that
 too
 much
 should
 not
 be
 made
 of
January's
 report,
 given
 that
 other
 reports
 have
 reflected
strength.

 
 
 
 But
 he
 acknowledged
 that
 the
 decline
 occurred
 despite
 a
 51
pct
 rise
 in
 defense
 orders,
 compared
 with
 a
 57.7
 pct
 decline
 in
December.

 
 
 
 He
 also
 noted
 that
 there
 was
 a
 6.9
 pct
 drop
 in
 January
shipments,
 compared
 with
 a
 5.4
 pct
 rise
 in
 December.

 
 
 
 "Given
 these
 numbers,
 there's
 no
 reason
 for
 the
 Fed
 to
tighten,"
 Data
 Resources'
 Wyss
 said.

 
 
 
 "But
 there's
 no
 reason
 to
 ease
 unless
 we
 see
 more
 numbers
like
 this.
 The
 Fed
 will
 wait
 and
 see,"
 he
 added.

 
 
 
 Sullivan
 predicted
 the
 Fed
 will
 ease
 by
 Easter.
 "People
aren't
 talking
 recession
 or
 Fed
 easing
 now,
 but
 the
 Fed
 will
have
 to
 ease
 to
 ensure
 global
 growth."

 Alan

 they
 introduced
 export
 licensing
reform
 legislation
 that
 could
 save
 U.S.

 hundreds
 of
thousands
 of
 dollars
 annually.

 
 
 
 "Our
 emphasis
 is
 two-fold:
 Decontrol
 and
 de-license
 items
where
 such
 actions
 will
 not
 endanger
 our
 national
 security,
 and
eliminate
 the
 Department
 of
 Defense's
 de

 veto
 authority
over
 the
 licensing
 process,"
 Cranston
 said.

 
 
 
 "Our
 reforms
 should
 reduce
 licensing
 requirements
 by
 65
 
 to
70
 pct,"
 he
 told
 reporters.
 "I
 am
 convinced
 that
 a
 more
rational...licensing
 process
 will
 boost
 exports."

 
 
 
 U.S.
 export
 controls
 are
 intended
 to
 deny
 Eastern
 bloc
countries
 access
 to
 technology
 that
 could
 further
 their
military
 capabilities.

 
 
 
 "By
 refocusing
 our
 control
 resources
 on
 higher
 levels
 of
technology,
 technology
 that
 is
 truly
 critical,
 we
 will
 do
 a
better
 job
 of
 preventing
 diversion
 of
 critical
 technology
 to
our
 adversaries
 while
 promoting
 more
 exports,"
 Cranston
 said.

 
 
 
 "We
 cannot
 expect
 to
 continue
 to
 play
 a
 leading
 role
 in
 new
technology
 development
 in

 if
 we
 unduly

<BODY>Argentina
 could
 suspend
 payments
 on
its
 foreign
 debt
 if
 creditor
 banks
 reject
 a
 2.15
 billion
 dlr
loan
 request
 to
 meet
 1987
 growth
 targets,
 ruling
 Radical
 Party
Deputy
 Raul
 Baglini
 told
 a
 local
 radio
 station.

 
 
 
 "Argentina
 does
 not
 discard
 the
 use
 of
 (a
 moratorium)
 if
 the
negotiations
 do
 not
 produce
 a
 result
 that
 guarantees
 the
 growth
of
 the
 country,"
 he
 added.

 
 
 
 Baglini,
 an
 observer
 at
 Argentina's
 negotiations
 in
 New
York
 with
 the
 steering
 committee
 for
 its
 320
 creditors
 banks,
told
 the
 Radio
 del
 Plata
 in
 a
 telephone
 interview
 that
 the
banks
 were
 divided
 on
 the
 loan
 request.

 
 
 
 Baglini
 said
 that
 as
 a
 result,
 today's
 scheduled
 second
 day
of
 talks
 had
 been
 postponed.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 Argentina
 was
 prepared
 to
 follow
 the
 example
 of
Brazil,
 which
 last
 week
 declared
 a
 moratorium
 on
 interest
payments
 of
 a
 large
 portion
 of
 its
 108
 billion
 dlr
 foreign
debt.

 
 
 
 Argentina's
 prime
 objective
 in
 renegotiating
 the
 debt
 was
to
 maintain
 growth,
 which
 has
 been
 targeted
 at
 four
 pct
 in
1987,
 Baglini
 said.

 
 
 
 "Debtor
 nations
 should
 not
 have
 to
 take
 from
 their
 own
pockets,
 that
 is
 their
 commercial
 balance,
 to
 meet
 interest
payments,"

 WRITERS
 SEEK
 ESTATE
 TAX
 CURBS</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 chairmen
 and
 senior
 Republican
members
 of
 the
 House
 and
 Senate
 tax
 writing
 committees
 proposed
legislation
 to
 curb
 estate
 tax
 deduction
 on
 sales
 of
 stock
 to
an
 employee
 stock
 ownership
 plan.

 
 
 
 The
 proposal
 would
 raise
 federal
 revenues
 of
 6.7
 billion
dlrs
 over
 the
 fiscal
 year
 period
 1987
 to
 1991.

 
 
 
 If
 adopted
 by
 Congress
 it
 would
 effect
 all
 transactions
after
 Sept
 26,
 1987.

 
 
 
 The
 plan
 was
 proposed
 by
 House
 Ways
 and
 Means
 Committee
Chairman
 Dan
 Rostenkowski
 (D-Ill),
 Rep
 John
 Duncan
 (R-Tenn),
Senate
 Finance
 Committee
 Chairman
 Lloyd
 Bentsen
 (D-Tex)
 and
 Sen
Bob
 Packwood
 (R-Ore).

 
 
 
 In
 a
 statement
 Rostenkowski
 said
 the
 estate
 tax
 deduction
enacted
 last
 year
 as
 part
 of
 the
 tax
 reform
 bill
 was
 too
 broad
and
 would
 have
 cost
 the
 governmet
 seven
 billion
 dlrs
 over
 four
years.
 The
 narrower
 deduction
 would
 cost
 the
 government
 less
than
 300
 mln
 dlrs
 for
 the
 same
 years.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 it
 was
 designed
 to
 avoid
 sham
 transactions
 which
allowed
 estates
 to
 avoid
 taxes
 by
 transferring
 stock
 to
 ESOPs.

 
 
 
 Senate
 Finance
 Committee
 chairman
 Lloyd
 Bentsen
 said
 in
 a
statement,
 "The
 Tax
 Reform
 Act
 contains
 a
 provision
 that
 allows
many
 wealthy
 individuals
 to
 avoid
 the
 federal
 estate
 tax
entirely
 when
 they
 die."

 
 
 
 He
 added,
 "The
 provision
 was
 intended
 to
 encourage
 estates
to
 sell
 stock
 to
 employee
 stock
 ownership
 plans
 as
 a
 way
 of
promoting
 worker
 ownership;
 however,
 the
 provision
 was
 not
meant
 to
 be
 broad
 enough
 to
 reduce
 federal
 revenues
 as
 much
 as
is
 currently
 estimated."

 
 
 
 He
 added,
 "The
 bill
 I
 have
 introduced
 today
 calls
 for
 the
modification
 of
 the
 provision
 in
 accordance
 with
 its
 intended
purpose."

 last
year
 and
 profit
 of

 mln
 dlrs,
 already
 publishes
 three
 daily
newspapers,
 including
 the
 tabloid
 Le
 Journal
 de
 Montreal,
 the
second-largest
 circulation
 paper
 in
 Canada.

 
 
 
 A
 new
 daily
 would
 give
 Montreal
 its
 second
 English-
language
 paper
 and
 its
 sixth
 daily
 newspaper,
 making
 the
 city
the
 most
 crowded
 metropolitan
 newspaper
 market
 in
 North
America,
 analysts
 have
 said.

 
 
 
 Peladeau
 said
 market
 studies
 have
 indicated
 a
 new
 English
language
 tabloid
 would
 have
 circulation
 of
 50,000
 within
 six
months.
 He
 said
 he
 is
 waiting
 to
 determine
 whether
 the
 new
venture
 would
 have
 the
 support
 of
 major
 advertisers.

 
 
 
 Peladeau,
 who
 together
 with
 family
 members
 owns
 about
 55
pct
 of
 Quebecor,
 said
 he
 has
 recieved
 offers
 from
 the
 heads
 of
two
 major
 Canadian
 companies
 who
 are
 interested
 in
 the
 project
but
 has
 not
 decided
 whether
 he
 would
 take
 partners
 in
 the
newspaper
 venture.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 he
 would
 consider
 launching
 the
 newspaper
 with
 one
of
 the
 companies
 as
 a
 prelude
 to
 other
 joint
 ventures.

 
 
 
 "It
 would
 be
 the
 possibility
 of
 doing
 something
 else
 in
 the
short
 term,"
 Peladeau
 said.

 
 
 
 Peladeau
 said
 the
 joint
 acquisition
 of
 Donohue
 with
 Robert
Maxwell's
 British
 Printing
 and
 Communications
 Corp
 plc
 &lt;BPCL.L>
does
 not
 mean
 Quebecor
 will
 have
 to
 hold
 off
 on
 other
 projects.

 
 
 
 Peladeau
 and
 Maxwell's
 companies
 teamed
 up
 to
 buy
 the
 stake
in
 Donohue,
 which
 resulted
 in
 Quebecor
 buying
 51
 pct
 of
 the
govvernment's
 stake
 for
 about
 165
 mln
 Canadian
 dlrs
 and
 British
printing
 acquiring
 the
 other
 49
 pct.

 
 
 
 "In
 1976
 or
 77
 there
 was
 a
 tremendous
 shortage
 of
newsprint.
 There
 were
 days
 when
 we
 didn't
 have
 enough
 paper
 to
print
 the
 paper,"
 Peladeau
 said.
 "When
 I
 lived
 that,
 I
 said
 to
myself...next
 time
 we'll
 be
 ready."

 
 
 
 Peladeau
 said
 most
 of
 Donohue's
 current
 total
 newsprint
capacity
 however,
 is
 already
 committed
 to
 other
 buyers.

 
 
 
 Quebecor
 uses
 about
 100,000
 metric
 tons
 of
 newsprint
 a
 year
and
 Maxwell's
 company,
 which
 publishes
 Britain's
 Daily
 Mirror
newspaper,
 uses
 about
 200,000
 tonnes.

 
 
 
 Peladeau
 said
 even
 with
 a
 new
 170
 mln
 dlr
 paper
 machine,
 49
pct
 owned
 by
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 (NYT.A),
 adding
 to
 Donohue's
540,000
 metric
 tonne
 capacity
 this
 fall,
 the
 companies
 will
have
 to
 install
 another
 paper
 machine
 at
 Amos,
 Quebec,
 or
 build
another
 mill
 to
 meet
 their
 demands
 .

 
 
 
 He
 said
 a
 new
 mill,
 which
 would
 produce
 either
 newsprint
 or
other
 types
 of
 paper,
 would
 cost
 400-500
 mln
 dlrs
 and
 could
 be
on
 stream
 in
 two
 years.
 He
 said
 a
 mill
 in
 Matane,
 a
 depressed
area
 with
 high
 unemployment,
 would
 be
 heavily
 subsidized
 by
 the
government.

 
 
 
 Peladeau
 said
 he
 is
 interested
 in
 further
 joint
 ventures
with
 Maxwell's
 company,
 either
 in
 the
 newspaper
 market
 in
France
 or
 in
 the
 U.S.,
 where
 the
 company
 owns
 two
 large
printing
 plants
 and
 is
 looking
 to
 expand
 its
 newspaper
 empire.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 Maxwell's
 sons,
 who
 are
 French
 citizens,
 would
provide
 an
 entree
 into
 the
 French
 market,
 where
 foreigners
 are
prevented
 from
 buying
 newspapers.
 Peladeau
 said
 he
 would
consider
 either
 buying
 into
 or
 starting
 daily
 newspapers
 in
France
 or
 the
 U.S.

 
 
 
 Quebecor
 is
 also
 in
 the
 process
 of
 expanding
 its
 chain
 of
about
 40
 weekly
 newspapers,
 with
 the
 possible
 acquisition
 of
two
 groups
 of
 weekly
 newspapers
 in
 the
 U.S.,
 and
 is
 negotiating
the
 acquisition
 of
 two
 weekly
 newspaper
 chains
 in
 Canada,
Peladeau
 said.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 the
 company
 may
 consider
 starting
 daily
 newspapers
in
 two
 small
 Quebec
 cities
 and
 buying
 radio
 stations
 in
 the
province.

 
 
 
 Peladeau
 said
 Quebecor
 may
 also
 consider
 trading
 in
 its
listing
 on
 the
 American
 stock
 exchange
 for
 a
 New
 York

<TITLE>IRAN
 ANNOUNCES
 END

 MAJOR
 OFFENSIVE
 IN
 GULF
 WAR</TITLE>
<BODY>Iran
 announced
 tonight
 that
 its
 major
offensive
 against
 Iraq
 in
 the
 Gulf
 war
 had
 ended
 after
 dealing
savage
 blows
 against
 the
 Baghdad
 government.

 
 
 
 The
 Iranian
 news
 agency
 IRNA,
 in
 a
 report
 received
 in
London,
 said
 the
 operation
 code-named
 Karbala-5
 launched
 into
Iraq
 on
 January
 9
 was
 now
 over.

 
 
 
 It
 quoted
 a
 joint
 statewment
 by
 the
 Iranian
 Army
 and
Revolutionary
 Guards
 Corps
 as
 saying
 that
 their
 forces
 had
"dealt
 one
 of
 the
 severest
 blows
 on
 the
 Iraqi
 war
 machine
 in
 the
history
 of
 the
 Iraq-imposed
 war."

 
 
 
 The
 statement
 by
 the
 Iranian
 High
 Command
 appeared
 to
herald
 the
 close
 of
 an
 assault
 on
 the
 port
 city
 of
 Basra
 in
southern
 Iraq.

 
 
 
 "The
 operation
 was
 launched
 at
 a
 time
 when
 the
 Baghdad
government
 was
 spreading
 extensive
 propaganda
 on
 the
 resistance
power
 of
 its
 army...,"
 said
 the
 statement
 quoted
 by
 IRNA.

 
 
 
 It
 claimed
 massive
 victories
 in
 the
 seven-week
 offensive
and
 called
 on
 supporters
 of
 Baghdad
 to
 "come
 to
 their
 senses"
 and
discontinue
 support
 for
 what
 it
 called
 the
 tottering
 regime
 in
Iraq.

 
 
 
 Iran
 said
 its
 forces
 had
 "liberated"
 155
 square
 kilometers
 of
enemy-occupied
 territory
 during
 the
 1987
 offensive
 and
 taken
over
 islands,
 townships,
 rivers
 and
 part
 of
 a
 road
 leading
 into
Basra.

 
 
 
 The
 Iranian
 forces
 "are
 in
 full
 control
 of
 these
 areas,"
 the
statement
 said.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 81
 Iraqi
 brigades
 and
 battalions
 were
 totally
destroyed,
 along
 with
 700
 tanks
 and
 1,500
 other
 vehicles.
 The
victory
 list
 also
 included
 80
 warplanes
 downed,
 250
 anti-
aircraft
 guns
 and
 400
 pieces
 of
 military
 hardware
 destroyed
 and
the
 seizure
 of
 220
 tanks
 and
 armoured

 carriers.

<BODY>U.S.
 bank
 discount
 window
 borrowings
less
 extended
 credits
 averaged
 310
 mln
 dlrs
 in
 the
 week
 to
Wednesday
 February
 25,
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 Fed
 said
 that
 overall
 borrowings
 in
 the
 week
 fell
 131
mln
 dlrs
 to
 614
 mln
 dlrs,
 with
 extended
 credits
 up
 10
 mln
 dlrs
at
 304
 mln
 dlrs.
 The
 week
 was
 the
 second
 half
 of
 a
 two-week
statement
 period.
 Net
 borrowings
 in
 the
 prior
 week
 averaged
 451
mln
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 Commenting
 on
 the
 two-week
 statement
 period
 ended
 February
25,
 the
 Fed
 said
 that
 banks
 had
 average
 net
 free
 reserves
 of
644
 mln
 dlrs
 a
 day,
 down
 from
 1.34
 billion
 two
 weeks
 earlier.

 
 
 
 A
 Federal
 Reserve
 spokesman
 told
 a
 press
 briefing
 that
there
 were
 no
 large
 single
 day
 net
 misses
 in
 the
 Fed's
 reserve
projections
 in
 the
 week
 to
 Wednesday.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 that
 natural
 float
 had
 been
 "acting
 a
 bit
strangely"
 for
 this
 time
 of
 year,
 noting
 that
 there
 had
 been
poor
 weather
 during
 the
 latest
 week.

 
 
 
 The
 spokesman
 said
 that
 natural
 float
 ranged
 from
 under
 500
mln
 dlrs
 on
 Friday,
 for
 which
 he
 could
 give
 no
 reason,
 to
nearly
 one
 billion
 dlrs
 on
 both
 Thursday
 and
 Wednesday.

 
 
 
 The
 Fed
 spokeman
 could
 give
 no
 reason
 for
 Thursday's
 high
float,
 but
 he
 said
 that
 about
 750
 mln
 dlrs
 of
 Wednesday's
float
 figure
 was
 due
 to
 holdover
 and
 transportation
 float
 at
two
 widely
 separated
 Fed
 districts.

 
 
 
 For
 the
 week
 as
 a
 whole,
 he
 said
 that
 float
 related
 as
 of
adjustments
 were
 "small,"
 adding
 that
 they
 fell
 to
 a
 negative
750
 mln
 dlrs
 on
 Tuesday
 due
 to
 a
 number
 of
 corrections
 for
unrelated
 cash
 letter
 errors
 in
 six
 districts
 around
 the
country.

 
 
 
 The
 spokesman
 said
 that
 on
 both
 Tuesday
 and
 Wednesday,
 two
different
 clearing
 banks
 had
 system
 problems
 and
 the
 securities
and
 Federal
 funds
 wires
 had
 to
 be
 held
 open
 until
 about
 2000
 or
2100
 EST
 on
 both
 days.

 
 
 
 However,
 he
 said
 that
 both
 problems
 were
 cleared
 up
 during
both
 afternoons
 and
 there
 was
 no
 evidence
 of
 any
 reserve
impact.

 
 
 
 During
 the
 week
 ended
 Wednesday,
 45
 pct
 of
 net
 discount
window
 borrowings
 were
 made
 by
 the
 smallest
 banks,
 with
 30
 pct
by
 the
 14
 large
 money
 center
 banks
 and
 25
 pct
 by
 large
 regional
institutions.

 
 
 
 On
 Wednesday,
 55
 pct
 of
 the
 borrowing
 was
 accounted
 for
 by
the
 money
 center
 banks,
 with
 30
 pct
 by
 the
 large
 regionals
 and
15
 pct
 by
 the
 smallest
 banks.

 
 
 
 The
 Fed
 spokesman
 said
 the
 banking
 system
 had
 excess
reserves
 on
 Thursday,
 Monday
 and
 Tuesday
 and
 a
 deficit
 on
Friday
 and
 Wedndsday.
 That
 produced
 a
 small
 daily
 average
deficit
 for
 the
 week
 as
 a
 whole.

 
 
 
 For
 the
 two-week
 period,
 he
 said
 there
 were
 relatively
 high
excess
 reserves
 on
 a
 daily
 avearge,
 almost
 all
 of
 which
 were
 at
the
 smallest
 banks.

<TITLE>AMERICAN
 EXPRESS
 &lt;AXP>
 SEEN
 IN
 POSSIBLE
 SPINNOFF</TITLE>
<BODY>American
 Express
 Co
 remained
 silent
 on
market
 rumors
 it
 would
 spinoff
 all
 or
 part
 of
 its
 Shearson
Lehman
 Brothers
 Inc,
 but
 some
 analysts
 said
 the
 company
 may
 be
considering
 such
 a
 move
 because
 it
 is
 unhappy
 with
 the
 market
value
 of
 its
 stock.

 
 
 
 American
 Express
 stock
 got
 a
 lift
 from
 the
 rumor,
 as
 the
market
 calculated
 a
 partially
 public
 Shearson
 may
 command
 a
good
 market
 value,
 thereby
 boosting
 the
 total
 value
 of
 American
Express.
 The
 rumor
 also
 was
 accompanied
 by
 talk
 the
 financial
services
 firm
 would
 split
 its
 stock
 and
 boost
 its
 dividend.

 
 
 
 American
 Express
 closed
 on
 the
 New
 York
 Stock
 Exchange
 at
72-5/8,
 up
 4-1/8
 on
 heavy
 volume.

 
 
 
 American
 Express
 would
 not
 comment
 on
 the
 rumors
 or
 its
stock
 activity.

 
 
 
 Analysts
 said
 comments
 by
 the
 company
 at
 an
 analysts'
meeting
 Tuesday
 helped
 fuel
 the
 rumors
 as
 did
 an
 announcement
yesterday
 of
 management
 changes.

 
 
 
 At
 the
 meeting,
 company
 officials
 said
 American
 Express
stock
 is
 undervalued
 and
 does
 not
 fully
 reflect
 the
 performance
of
 Shearson,
 according
 to
 analysts.

 
 
 
 Yesterday,
 Shearson
 said
 it
 was
 elevating
 its
 chief
operating
 officer,
 Jeffery
 Lane,
 to
 the
 added
 position
 of
president,
 which
 had
 been
 vacant.
 It
 also
 created
 four
 new
positions
 for
 chairmen
 of
 its
 operating
 divisions.

 
 
 
 Analysts
 speculated
 a
 partial
 spinoff
 would
 make
 most
sense,
 contrary
 to
 one
 variation
 on
 market
 rumors
 of
 a
 total
spinoff.

 
 
 
 Some
 analysts,
 however,
 disagreed
 that
 any
 spinoff
 of
Shearson
 would
 be
 good
 since
 it
 is
 a
 strong
 profit
 center
 for
American
 Express,
 contributing
 about
 20
 pct
 of
 earnings
 last
year.

 
 
 
 "I
 think
 it
 is
 highly
 unlikely
 that
 American
 Express
 is
going
 to
 sell
 shearson,"
 said
 Perrin
 Long
 of
 Lipper
 Analytical.
He
 questioned
 what
 would
 be
 a
 better
 investment
 than
 "a
 very
profitable
 securities
 firm."

 
 
 
 Several
 analysts
 said
 American
 Express
 is
 not
 in
 need
 of
cash,
 which
 might
 be
 the
 only
 reason
 to
 sell
 a
 part
 of
 a
 strong
asset.

 
 
 
 But
 others
 believe
 the
 company
 could
 very
 well
 of
considered
 the
 option
 of
 spinning
 out
 part
 of
 Shearson,
 and
 one
rumor
 suggests
 selling
 about
 20
 pct
 of
 it
 in
 the
 market.

 
 
 
 Larry
 Eckenfelder
 of
 Prudential-Bache
 Securities
 said
 he
believes
 American
 Express
 could
 have
 considered
 a
 partial
spinoff
 in
 the
 past.

 
 
 
 "Shearson
 being
 as
 profitable
 as
 it
 is
 would
 have
 fetched
 a
big
 premium
 in
 the
 market
 place.
 Shearson's
 book
 value
 is
 in
the
 1.4
 mln
 dlr
 range.
 Shearson
 in
 the
 market
 place
 would
probably
 be
 worth
 three
 to
 3.5
 bilion
 dlrs
 in
 terms
 of
 market
capitalization,"
 said
 Eckenfelder.

 
 
 
 Some
 analysts
 said
 American
 Express
 could
 use
 capital
 since
it
 plans
 to
 expand
 globally.

 
 
 
 "They
 have
 enormous
 internal
 growth
 plans
 that
 takes
capital.
 You
 want
 your
 stock
 to
 reflect
 realistic
 valuations
 to
enhance
 your
 ability
 to
 make
 all
 kinds
 of
 endeavors
 down
 the
road,"
 said
 E.F.
 Hutton
 Group
 analyst
 Michael
 Lewis.

 
 
 
 "They've
 outlined
 the
 fact
 that
 they're
 investing
 heavily
in
 the
 future,
 which
 goes
 heavily
 into
 the
 international
arena,"
 said
 Lewis.
 "...That
 does
 not
 preclude
 acquisitions
 and
divestitures
 along
 the
 way,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 Lewis
 said
 if
 American
 Express
 reduced
 its
 exposure
 to
 the
brokerage
 business
 by
 selling
 part
 of
 shearson,
 its
 stock
 might
better
 reflect
 other
 assets,
 such
 as
 the
 travel
 related
services
 business.

 
 
 
 "It
 could
 find
 its
 true
 water
 mark
 with
 a
 lesser
 exposure
to
 brokerage.
 The
 value
 of
 the
 other
 components
 could
 command
 a
higher
 multiple
 because
 they
 constitute
 a
 higher
 percentage
 of
the
 total
 operating
 earnings
 of
 the
 company,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 
 Lewis
 said
 Shearson
 contributed
 316
 mln
 in
 after-tax
operating
 earnings,
 up
 from
 about
 200
 mln
 dlrs
 in
 1985.

 and

 based
 on

 in
 the
 U.K.,
 Chairman
 Sir
John
 Egan
 told
 a
 news
 conference.

 
 
 
 Commenting
 on
 an
 11

 growth
 in
 1986
 group
 turnover
 to
830.4

 stg
 and
 pre-tax
 profits
 at
 120.8
 mln
 stg,
 slightly
below
 1985's
 121.3
 mln,
 Egan
 said
 Jaguar
 aimed
 at
 an
 average
profit
 growth
 of
 15
 pct
 per
 year.
 However,
 the
 introduction
 of
the
 new
 model
 had
 kept
 this
 year's
 pre-tax
 profit
 down.

 
 
 
 Jaguar
 starts
 selling
 XJ-6
 in
 the
 U.S.
 In
 May
 and
 plans
 to
sell
 25,000
 of
 its
 total
 47,000
 production
 there
 in
 1987.

 
 
 
 U.S.
 Sales
 now
 account
 for
 65
 pct
 of
 total
 turnover,
finance
 director
 John
 Edwards
 said.

 
 
 
 A
 U.S.
 Price
 for
 the
 car
 has
 not
 been
 set
 yet,
 but
 Edwards
said
 the
 relatively
 high
 car
 prices
 in
 dollars
 of
 West
 German
competitors
 offered
 an
 "umbrella"
 for
 Jaguar.
 He
 added
 the
 XJ-6
had
 also
 to
 compete
 with
 U.S.
 Luxury
 car
 producers
 which
 would
restrict
 the
 car's
 price.

 
 
 
 Jaguar
 hedges
 a
 majority
 of
 its
 dollar
 receipts
 on
 a
12-month
 rolling
 basis
 and
 plans
 to
 do
 so
 for
 a
 larger
 part
 of
its
 receipts
 for
 longer
 periods,
 John
 Egan
 said.

 
 
 
 In
 the
 longer
 term,
 capital
 expenditure
 will
 amount
 to
 10
pct
 of
 net
 sales.
 Research
 and
 development
 will
 cost
 four
 pct
of
 net
 sales
 and
 training
 two
 pct.

 
 
 
 Jaguar
 builds
 half
 of
 its
 cars
 and
 buys
 components
 for
 the
other
 half.
 The
 firm
 is
 in
 early
 stages
 of
 considering
 the
building
 of
 an
 own
 press
 shop
 in
 Britain
 for
 about
 80
 mln

but
 Egan
 said
 this

 it

 bills

 the

 Against
 this,
 a

 would
 add

 NO
 MAJOR

 FROM

 REMOVAL</TITLE>
<BODY>Inco
 Ltd
 said
 it
 did
 not
 expect
 its
earlier
 reported
 removal
 from
 the
 Dow
 Jones
 industrial
 index
 to
make
 a
 major
 impact
 on
 the
 company's
 stock.

 
 
 
 "We
 don't
 think
 that
 individuals
 or
 institutions
 buy
 our
shares
 because
 we
 were
 one
 of
 the
 Dow
 Jones
 industrials,"
spokesman
 Ken
 Cherney
 said
 in
 reply
 to
 a
 query.

 
 
 
 Inco
 closed
 1-3/8
 lower
 at
 19-3/8
 in
 second
 most
 active
trading
 on
 the
 Toronto
 Stock
 Exchange.

 
 
 
 The
 Wall
 Street
 Journal,
 which
 selects
 the
 index,
 said
 Inco
was
 dropped
 to
 make
 the
 index
 more
 representative
 of
 the
market.
 Inco,
 the
 non-Communist
 world's
 largest
 nickel
producer,
 was
 a
 member
 of
 the
 index
 since
 1928.

 
 
 
 Replacing
 Inco
 and
 Owens-Illinois
 Inc
 will
 be
 Coca-Cola
 Co
and
 Boeing
 Co,
 effective
 tomorrow.

 
 
 
 Nickel
 analyst
 Ilmar
 Martens
 at
 Walwyn
 Stodgell
 Cochran
Murray
 Ltd
 said
 Inco's
 removal
 from
 the
 index
 would
 likely
spark
 short-term
 selling
 pressure
 on
 the
 stock.

 
 
 
 "Some
 investors
 who
 have
 Inco
 may
 suddenly
 say,
 'well,
because
 it's
 not
 now
 a
 Dow
 stock,
 we
 should
 eliminate
 that
investment,'"
 said
 Martens,
 although
 he
 added
 the
 move
 was
unlikely
 to
 have
 a
 serious
 long-term
 impact
 on
 Inco
 stock.

 
 
 
 Inco
 has
 struggled
 in
 recent

 against
 sharply
 lower

 Its

 ISSUE
 FOR
 U.S.

<BODY>CitiCorp
 &lt;CCI>
 appears
 to
 be
 digging
in
 its
 heels
 for
 tough
 negotiations
 over
 the
 billions
 of
dollars
 in
 loans
 that
 Brazil
 owes
 to
 money
 center
 banks,
 Wall
Street
 analysts
 said.

 
 
 
 "I
 view
 it
 as
 pre-negotiation
 posturing,"
 said
 analyst
Carole
 Berger
 of
 Cyrus
 J.
 Lawrence
 Inc,
 referring
 to
 both
Brazil
 and
 Citicorp.
 Brazil
 recently
 stopped
 paying
 interest
 on
its
 commercial
 bank
 debt.
 Today,
 CitiCorp
 said
 its
 first
quarter
 income
 would
 be
 reduced
 by
 50
 mln
 dlrs
 after
 tax
 if
 it
lists
 the
 loans
 as
 non-performing
 status.

 
 
 
 Citicorp
 filed
 an
 8-K
 form
 with
 the
 Securities
 and
 Exchange
Commission,
 indicating
 a
 material
 change
 in
 its
 financial
situation.
 "Citicorp
 is
 saying
 you
 can't
 scare
 us
 with
 threats,
we'll
 make
 your
 loans
 non-performing
 right
 now,"
 Berger
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 loans
 have
 to
 be
 treated
 as
 non-performing
 after
 90
days
 without
 a
 payment.
 CitiCorp
 said
 only
 that
 the
 situation
will
 be
 reviewed
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 current
 quarter.

 
 
 
 Berger
 asserted
 that
 Brazil
 is
 doing
 its
 own
 politicking
 by
talking
 to
 U.S.
 regulators
 and
 trying
 to
 drive
 a
 wedge
 between
U.S.
 and
 European
 banks.

 
 
 
 Analyst
 Lawrence
 Cohn
 of
 Merrill
 Lynch
 and
 Co
 said
 it
 is
unlikely
 the
 situation
 will
 be
 resolved
 until
 the
 second
 half
of
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 "Ultimately
 the
 Brazilians
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 pay
 up
 on
all
 the
 interest
 they
 owe,"
 Cohn
 said.
 "The
 real
 issue
 is
 the
rescheduling
 of
 debt
 terms.

 
 
 
 Another
 question
 is
 whether
 or
 not
 the
 International
Monetary
 Fund
 can
 help
 Brazil
 with
 a
 new
 austerity
 program.

 
 
 
 Stocks
 of
 money
 center
 banks
 were
 mostly
 down
 fractions
 in
late
 dealings.
 One
 trader
 most
 stocks
 in
 the
 group
 bounced
 off
their
 lows
 by
 midday
 as
 investors
 took
 the
 news
 in
 stride.

 
 
 
 Cohn
 said
 the
 bank
 stocks
 may
 be
 risky
 until
 numbers
 on
non-performing
 loans
 are
 reported
 for
 each
 bank.
 But
 he
 said
investors
 looking
 ahead
 six
 to
 12
 months
 might
 want
 to
 buy
 at
present
 levels
 for
 the
 "tremendous
 fundamental
 values"
 in
 the
group.

 
 
 
 Analyst
 Robert
 Gordon
 of
 Shearson
 Lehman
 Brothers
 Inc
 said
Manufacturers
 Hanover
 Corp
 &lt;MHC)
 has
 the
 greatest
 exposure
 to
Brazilian
 loans
 of
 any
 New
 York
 bank,
 in
 terms
 of
 percentage
 of
earnings.
 He
 said
 his
 only
 two
 recommendations
 currently
 among
New
 York
 banks
 are
 J.P.
 Morgan
 and
 Co
 &lt;JPM>
 and
 Bankers
 Trust
Co
 &lt;BT>
 which
 happen
 to
 have
 the
 least
 exposure.

 
 
 
 Gordon
 said
 his
 positive
 opinion
 on
 J.P.
 Morgan
 and
 Bankers
Trust
 was
 not
 merely
 a
 response
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 two
 have
lower
 exposure
 to
 Brazilian
 loans
 than
 other
 banks.
 

 
 
 
 In
 fact
 he
 said
 there's
 a
 chance
 those
 banks
 could
 get
 more
involved
 in
 the
 future.
 He
 noted
 that
 Morgan
 has
 already
 set
 up
a
 brokerage
 subsidiary
 to
 deal
 in
 loans
 to
 less
 developed
countries.

 
 
 
 "I
 don't
 see
 any
 reason
 to
 change
 full
 year
 earnings
estimates,
 said
 Frederick
 Meinke,
 analyst
 at
 E.F.
 Hutton
 Co.
 He
thinks
 the
 confrontation
 with
 Brazil
 could
 end
 in
 a
 replay
 of
 a
situation
 that
 occurred
 with
 Argentina
 in
 1984
 and
 1985.

 
 
 
 Meinke
 noted
 that
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Argentina
 the
 loans
 became
non-accruing
 for
 a
 couple
 of
 quarters
 but
 then
 when
 the
 banks
came
 to
 an
 agreement
 with
 Argentina
 all
 the
 back
 interest
 was
paid.
 "What
 it
 did
 was
 distort
 the
 quarterly
 earnings
 pattern,"
he
 said.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Brazil
 write-offs
 of
 loans
 is
 a
worst-case
 outcome
 which
 is
 highly
 unlikely.
 He
 noted
 that
Brazil
 is
 a
 country
 with
 a
 diversified
 economy,
 going
 through
some
 economic
 upheaval
 after
 the
 transition
 from
 a
 military
 to
a
 civilian
 government.

 
 
 
 "The
 countries
 of
 Latin
 America
 have
 too
 much
 debt
 relative
to
 their
 ability
 to
 service
 it,"
 said
 John
 Mason
 of
Interstate
 Securities.
 "We've
 been
 fiddling
 around
 with
 these
problems
 for
 five
 years
 and
 the
 hour
 is
 growing
 late."

 
 
 
 He
 said
 up
 to
 now
 the
 banks
 have
 reduced
 their
 spreads,
 cut
interest
 rates
 internally
 and
 extended
 maturities
 and
 none
 of
these
 measures
 has
 been
 enough.
 He
 expects
 re-classification
 of
as
 much
 as
 a
 third
 of
 the
 loans
 as
 non-accruing
 and
 he
 sees
partial
 write
 downs
 of
 some
 loans.

 
 
 
 Nevertheless
 Mason
 thinks
 the
 money
 center
 bank
 stocks
 
could
 be
 poised
 for
 a
 short
 term
 rally.

 
 
 
 A
 spokesman
 at
 First
 Chicago
 Corp
 &lt;FNB>
 said
 it
 is
premature
 to
 put
 Brazil's
 loans
 on
 a
 cash
 basis.
 "It
 is
 our
expectation
 that
 economic
 development
 will
 allow
 Brazil
 to
 meet
its
 debt,"
 a
 spokesman
 said.

 
 
 
 Bankers
 Trust
 in
 New
 York
 said
 it
 would
 be
 premature
 to
make
 a
 decision.
 Several
 other
 banks
 queried
 by
 Reuters
 said
much
 the
 same
 thing.

 
 
 
 A
 spokesman
 at
 Manufacturers
 Hanover
 noted

 it
 has
 bought
 10.4

 At

 it

 the

<TITLE>DOCTORS
 FIND
 LINK
 BETWEEN
 AIDS,
 SMALLPOX
 VIRUS</TITLE>
<BODY>In
 a
 discovery
 that
 could
 complicate
 the
search
 for
 an
 AIDS
 vaccine,
 a
 team
 of
 U.S.
 Army
 doctors
 said
they
 have
 uncovered
 a
 potentially-fatal
 interaction
 between
 the
AIDS
 virus
 and
 a
 virus
 used
 to
 protect
 against
 smallpox.

 
 
 
 
 Physicians
 at
 the
 Walter
 Reed
 Army
 Institute
 of
 Research
said
 a
 19-year-old
 man,
 who
 apparently
 had
 been
 exposed
 to
 the
AIDS
 virus,
 developed
 a
 pox-like
 disease
 and
 died
 after
receiving
 the
 smallpox
 vaccine.
 The
 military
 now
 tests
 recruits
for
 AIDS
 before
 vaccinating
 them.

 
 
 
 The
 findings,
 reported
 in
 The
 New
 England
 Journal
 of
Medicine,
 are
 significant
 because
 scientists
 have
 begun
 working
on
 an
 AIDS
 vaccine
 that
 relies
 on
 the
 smallpox
 vaccine.

 
 
 
 
 "Our
 case
 report
 raises
 provocative
 questions
 concerning
the
 ultimate
 safety
 of
 such
 vaccines,"
 said
 the
 group
 led
 by
Dr.
 Robert
 Redfield.

 
 
 
 
 The
 report
 also
 throws
 into
 question
 the
 belief
 held
 by
some
 scientists
 that
 the
 smallpox
 vaccine,
 which
 exposes
 people
to
 a
 milder,
 protective
 form
 of
 the
 disease
 known
 as
 cowpox,
could
 be
 further

<TITLE>BIRTH

 HELP
 PREVENT
 CANCER
 -
 STUDY</TITLE>
<BODY>Doctors
 at
 the
 Centers
 for
 Disease
Control
 in
 Atlanta
 said
 they
 have
 new
 evidence
 that
 birth
control
 pills
 can
 help
 provide
 long-term
 protection
 from
 cancer
of
 the
 ovary,
 even
 if
 the
 pills
 are
 only
 taken
 for
 a
 few
months.

 
 
 
 
 The
 study,
 reported
 in
 the
 New
 England
 Journal
 of
Medicine,
 also
 found
 that
 all
 the
 various
 types
 of
 oral
contraceptives
 on
 the
 market
 were
 equally
 effective
 in
 lowering
the
 rate
 of
 ovarian
 cancer.

 
 
 
 
 The
 researchers
 estimated
 that
 the
 use
 of
 birth
 control
pills
 in
 this
 country
 probably
 prevented
 about
 1,700
 cases
 of
ovarian
 cancer
 in
 1982.

 
 
 
 As
 more
 and
 more
 women
 who
 have
 taken
 oral
 contraceptives
"move
 into
 the
 age
 groups
 that
 are
 at
 highest
 risk
 for
epithelial
 ovarian
 cancer
 we
 may
 witness
 a
 declining
 incidence
of
 this
 serious
 disease,"
 they
 said.

 
 
 
 
 Specifically,
 the
 team
 led
 by
 Dr.
 Howard
 Ory
 found
 that
"oral
 contraceptive
 use,
 even
 for
 a
 few
 months,
 reduces
 the
risk
 of
 epithelial
 ovarian
 cancer
 by
 40
 percent
 for
 women
 20
 to
54
 years
 of
 age.

 
 
 
 
 "The
 effect
 probably
 takes
 from
 five
 to
 ten
 years
 to
become
 apparent,
 but
 it
 persists
 long
 after
 the
 use
 of
 oral
contraceptives
 ends.
 Moreover,
 protection
 exists
 regardless
 of
the
 formulation
 of
 oral
 contraceptive
 used,"
 they
 said.

<BODY>U.S.
 economic
 data
 this

 could
 be
the
 key
 in
 determining
 whether
 U.S.
 interest
 rate
 futures
 break
out
 of
 a
 3-1/2
 month
 trading
 range,
 financial
 analysts
 said.

 
 
 
 Although
 market
 expectations
 are
 for
 February
 U.S.
 retail
sales
 Thursday
 and
 industrial
 production
 Friday
 to
 show
 healthy
gains,
 figures
 within
 or
 slightly
 below
 expectations
 would
 be
positive
 for
 the
 market,
 the
 analysts
 said.

 
 
 
 "You
 have
 to
 be
 impressed
 with
 the
 resiliency
 of
 bonds
right
 now,"
 said
 Smith
 Barney
 Harris
 Upham
 analyst
 Craig
Sloane.

 
 
 
 Treasury
 bond
 futures
 came
 under
 pressure
 today
 which
traders
 linked
 to
 a
 persistently
 firm
 federal
 funds
 rate
 and
 a
rise
 in
 oil
 prices.
 However,
 when
 sufficient
 selling
 interest
to
 break
 below
 chart
 support
 in
 the
 June
 contract
 failed
 to
materialize,
 participants
 who
 had
 sold
 bond
 futures
 early
quickly
 covered
 short
 positions,
 they
 said.

 
 
 
 "Everyone
 is
 expecting
 strong
 numbers,
 and
 if
 they
 come
 in
as
 expected
 it
 won't
 be
 that
 bad
 for
 the
 market,"
 Sloane
 said.

 
 
 
 Sloane
 said
 the
 consensus
 estimate
 for
 the
 non-auto
 sector
of
 retail
 sales
 is
 for
 a
 rise
 of
 0.6
 to
 0.7
 pct.

 
 
 
 Dean
 Witter
 analyst
 Karen
 Gibbs
 said
 a
 retail
 sales
 figure
below
 market
 forecasts
 would
 give
 a
 boost
 to
 debt
 futures,
 and
she
 put
 the
 range
 for
 the
 non-auto
 sector
 of
 retail
 sales
 at
 up
0.8
 to
 1.2
 pct.

 
 
 
 Industrial
 production
 and
 the
 producer
 price
 index
 Friday
both
 are
 expected
 to
 show
 increases
 of
 about
 0.5
 pct,
 she
added.

 
 
 
 Retail
 sales
 "will
 tell
 us
 whether
 or
 not
 we
 will
 be
 able
to
 fill
 the
 gap,"
 Gibbs
 said,
 referring
 to
 a
 chart
 gap
 in
 June
bonds
 between
 100-26/32
 and
 101-3/32
 created
 Friday.
 June
 bonds
closed
 at
 100-4/32
 today.

 
 
 
 Also
 key
 to
 debt
 futures
 direction,
 in
 addition
 to
 the
federal
 funds
 rate,
 is
 the
 direction
 of
 crude
 oil
 prices,
 said
Carroll
 McEntee
 and
 McGinley
 Futures
 analyst
 Brian
 Singer.

 
 
 
 "A
 higher
 fed
 funds
 rate
 and
 firm
 oil
 prices
 precluded
 the
market
 from
 breaking
 out
 of
 the
 trading
 range
 the
 last
 time
 the
market
 approached
 the
 top
 of
 the
 range,"
 Singer
 said.

 
 
 
 In
 order
 for
 bonds
 to
 break
 above
 the
 top
 of
 the
 range,
which
 is
 just
 below
 102
 in
 the
 June
 contract,
 "the
 crude
 oil
rally
 needs
 to
 run
 its
 course
 and
 pull
 back
 a
 little
 bit,"
Singer
 said.
 "Fed
 funds
 are
 already
 easing
 back
 down
 toward
 the
six
 pct
 level."

 
 
 
 The
 recent
 surge
 in
 oil
 prices
 has
 also
 been
 a
 concern
 to
Manufacturers
 Hanover
 Futures
 analyst
 Jim
 Rozich,
 but
 the
 rally
may
 be
 nearing
 a
 top
 around
 18.50
 dlrs
 per
 barrel,
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 Rozich
 said
 he
 is
 looking
 for
 the
 June
 bond
 contract
 to
ease
 to
 99-6/32
 and
 find
 support.

 
 
 
 "I'm
 not
 quite
 ready
 to
 jump
 on
 the
 bullish
 bandwagon
 yet.
The
 jury
 is
 still
 out
 this

 Rozich
 said.

 today
 outlined
 a

 "action
 program"
 for
 sub-Saharan
Africa
 focusing
 heavily
 on
 economic

 and
 self-help.

 
 
 
 A

 and

in

 to
 end
 hunger
 in
 the
 region
 through
economic
 growth,
 policy
 reform
 and
 private

 development."

 
 
 
 The
 statement
 said
 the
 "program
 of
 action"
 was
 recommended
 by
a
 White
 House
 task
 force
 set
 up
 last
 September.

 
 
 
 In
 a
 series
 of
 recommendations,
 the
 task
 force
 called
 for
new
 efforts
 to
 address
 Africa's
 heavy
 debt
 burden
 and
 said
 U.S.
food
 aid
 should
 stress
 production
 incentives
 to
 reinforce
African
 nations'
 economic
 reform
 and
 productivity.

 
 
 
 It
 also
 said
 better
 African
 access
 to
 world
 markets
 should
be
 promoted
 to
 reward
 good
 performance
 and
 enable
 African
nations
 to
 earn
 their
 way
 toward
 economic
 growth.

 
 
 
 The
 U.S.
 private
 sector
 should
 be
 mobilized
 to
 provide
"private,
 voluntary
 and
 corporate
 involvement
 of
 a
 humanitarian

 
 
 
 It
 said
 donor
 countries
 "should
 negotiate,
 through

 coordination
process,
 framework
 agreements
 with
 each
 sub-Saharan
 African
country
 to
 establish
 long-term
 structural
 adjustment
 and
 reform
programs."

 
 
 
 The
 task
 force
 called
 for
 a
 separate
 budget
 account
 for
U.S.
 bilateral
 aid
 "in
 order
 to
 focus
 better
 on
 rewarding

 performance

<BODY>In

 225
 mln
 dlr
 issue
 of
convertible

 market
 preferred
 stock
 through
 Shearson
Lehman
 Brothers
 Inc
 as
 sole

 Shearson,
 which
 originated
 the
 new
 convertible
 concept,
said
 each
 of
 the
 three
 tranches
 totaled
 75
 mln
 dlrs.
 In
 the
first,
 a
 2.85
 pct
 dividend
 was
 set
 on
 the
 stock
 with
 a
 strike
price
 of
 190
 dlrs
 that
 represented
 a
 15
 pct
 premium
 over
 the
common
 stock
 price
 when
 terms
 were
 set.

 
 
 
 Also
 included
 were
 4.36
 pct

 with
 a

 strike
 price
 and
 33
 pct
 premium
 and

 price
 and
 42

 premium.

 
 
 
 Texas
 Instruments
 common
 closed
 at
 167.25
 dlrs,
 up
 2-1/8.

 
 
 
 Ronald
 Gallatin,
 managing
 director
 at
 Shearson,
 said
 that
"demand
 for
 the
 offering
 was
 unbelievable,
 especially
 for
 the
first
 tranche."

 
 
 
 He
 said
 that
 Shearson
 originated
 the
 concept
 of
 auction
money
 market
 preferred
 stock
 three
 years
 ago.
 The
 conversion
feature
 of
 this
 issue
 is
 the
 new
 wrinkle.

 
 
 
 Commenting
 on
 the
 first
 tranche,
 Gallatin
 noted
 that
 the
original
 pricing
 talk
 called
 for
 a
 dividend
 in
 the
 four
 to
 4.20
pct
 area.
 This
 was
 gradually
 cut
 to
 2.85
 pct
 because
 of
 intense
demand,
 saving
 the
 issuer
 money
 in
 financing
 costs.

 
 
 
 The
 Shearson
 official
 said
 that
 virtually
 all
 buyers
 of
 the
first
 tranche
 received
 less
 than
 they
 wanted.
 He
 said
 the
latter
 two
 tranches
 were
 less
 strongly
 oversubscribed.

 
 
 
 Like
 non-convertible
 money
 market
 preferred
 stock,
 the
 new
version
 allows
 investors
 to
 redeem
 their
 holdings
 every
 seven
weeks.
 Investors
 then
 can
 maintain
 their
 holdings,
 sell
 them,
or
 offer
 to

<TITLE>CLARK

 U.S.
 ACTION
 ON
 ACID
 RAIN</TITLE>
<BODY>Canadian
 Foreign
 Secretary
 Joe
Clark,
 winding
 up
 a
 two-day
 visit
 to
 Washington,
 said
 he
expected
 the
 Reagan
 administration
 to
 take
 some
 action
 on
reducing
 acid
 rain.

 
 
 
 "My
 impression
 is
 there
 will
 be
 some
 movement
 by
 the
 United
States
 administration
 on
 acid
 rain
 (but)
 how
 much
 movement
 I
can't
 judge
 or
 predict,"
 he
 told
 reporters.

 
 
 
 The
 meetings
 with
 American
 officials
 are
 part
 of
 a
 routine
U.S.-Canada
 consultation
 but
 are
 also
 expected
 to
 lay
 the
groundwork
 for
 a
 summit
 in
 Ottawa
 next
 month
 between
 President
Reagan
 and
 Prime
 Minister
 Brian
 Mulroney.

 
 
 
 Clark
 today
 held
 discussions
 with
 Treasury
 Secretary
 James
Baker
 and
 Democratic
 Sens.
 Patrick
 Moynihan
 of
 New
 York,
Christopher
 Dodd
 of
 Connecticut,
 Lloyd
 Bentsen
 of
 Texas
 and
George
 Mitchell
 of
 Maine.

 
 
 
 Yesterday,
 he
 held
 talks
 with
 Vice
 President
 George
 Bush,
Secretary
 of
 State
 George
 Shultz
 and
 Commerce
 Secretary
 Malcolm
Baldrige.

 
 
 
 Among
 its
 priorities,
 Canada
 is
 seeking
 evidence
 that
Reagan
 is
 prepared
 to
 live
 up
 to
 a
 commitment
 made
 last
 year
 to
implement
 in
 the
 United
 States
 a
 five-year
 5
 billion
 U.S.
 dlr
program
 to
 test
 cleaner
 ways
 of
 burning
 coal.

 
 
 
 This
 issue
 was
 discussed
 at
 length
 with
 Baker
 and
 several
of
 the
 senators,
 including
 Mitchell
 who
 urged
 Canada
 to
 "keep
the
 heat
 on"
 the
 Reagan
 administration
 to
 force
 action,
 Canadian
officials
 said.

 
 
 
 Also
 taken
 up
 with
 most
 of
 the
 senators
 and
 Baker
 were
trade
 issues,
 including
 the
 need
 for
 the
 United

 and
Canada
 to
 establish
 a
 better
 mechanism
 for
 settling
 trade
disputes
 between
 the
 two
 countries,
 who
 are
 each
 other's
 major

 partner,
 Canadian

 said.

<TITLE>FASTER
 TEST
 FOR
 SICKLE
 CELL
 ANEMIA
 DEVELOPED</TITLE>
<BODY>A
 team
 of
 California
 researchers
 said
that
 they
 have
 developed
 a
 better,
 faster
 test
 for
 detecting
sickle
 cell
 anemia
 in
 unborn
 children
 than
 existing
 procedures.

 
 
 
 
 The
 test,
 developed
 by
 Cetus
 Corp
 &lt;CTUS>
 researchers,
requires
 only
 a
 small
 amount
 of
 genetic
 material
 from
 a
 fetus
and
 produces
 a
 diagnosis
 within
 a
 day,
 unlike
 other
 tests
 that
require
 several
 days
 and
 can
 only
 be
 done
 in
 a
 few
 specialized
centers,
 they
 said.

 
 
 
 
 Sickle
 cell
 anemia
 is
 a
 painful,
 inherited
 blood
 disease
that
 causes
 the
 normally-flexible
 red
 blood
 cells
 to
 stiffen
into
 a
 sickle-like
 shape.
 It
 is
 primarily
 found
 in
 blacks.

 
 
 
 The
 researchers
 said
 in
 The
 New
 England
 Journal
 of
 Medicine
that
 their
 "procedure
 promises
 to
 be
 a
 rapid,
 sensitive
 and
reliable
 method
 for
 the
 prenatal
 diagnosis
 of
 sickle
 cell
disease."

 
 
 
 
 In
 addition,
 they
 said,
 the
 technique
 might
 also
 be
adapted
 to
 detect
 other
 types
 of
 genetic
 disease.

 COULD

 limit
 the

 activities
 of
 its
members
 in
 London
 in
 stocks
 listed
 on
 both

 sources
at

 said.

 
 
 
 This
 could
 arise
 if
 the
 London
 Stock
 Exchange
 goes
 ahead
with
 plans
 to
 close
 its
 trading
 floor.

 
 
 
 The
 London
 Exchange
 sources
 were
 commenting
 on
 press
reports
 that
 the
 NYSE
 would
 bar
 its
 members
 firms
 from
 trading
on
 the
 London
 Exchange
 in
 interlisted
 stocks
 during
 periods
when
 the
 NYSE
 was
 open.

 
 
 
 The
 London
 exchange
 is
 seeking
 clarification.

 
 
 
 London
 Exchange
 sources
 said
 the
 possibility
 of
restrictions
 on
 NYSE
 members
 appears
 to
 reflect
 a
 rule
 which
requires
 that
 exchanges
 recognised
 by
 the
 NYSE
 possess
 a
trading
 floor.

 
 
 
 Last
 month,
 the
 London
 Exchange
 said
 in
 a
 statement
 that
 it
planned
 to
 close
 its
 floor
 in
 due
 course,
 apart
 from
 a
 floor
for
 traded
 options,
 because
 almost
 all
 business
 is
 now
 being
done
 by
 screen
 and
 telephone
 between
 brokerage
 offices.

 
 
 
 This
 development
 stemmed
 from
 the
 Big
 Bang
 restructuring
 of
the
 market
 on
 October
 27.
 The
 demise
 of
 the
 traditional
 Stock
Exchange
 floor
 has
 been
 widely
 expected,
 though
 no
 date
 has
been
 set
 as
 yet.

 
 
 
 Market
 sources
 said
 a
 compromise
 over
 the
 NYSE
 rule
 could
well
 be
 reached,
 partly
 because
 the
 interests
 of
 U.S.
Securities
 dealers
 are
 not
 all
 identical.

 
 
 
 Some
 of
 them
 could
 well
 start
 lobbying
 the
 NYSE,
 pointing
out,
 among
 other
 things,
 that
 the
 expansion
 of
 global
 trading
needs
 to
 be
 based
 on
 reciprocal
 arrangements.

 
 
 
 NYSE
 brokerage
 firms
 which
 also
 trade
 on
 the
 London
Exchange
 would
 presumably
 be
 put
 at
 a
 disadvantage
 over
non-NYSE
 U.S.

 which

 CGE

 LIKELY

 BE
 PRIVATISED
 IN

<BODY>France's
 state-owned

 (CGE)
 is
 likely
 to
 be
 privatised
 during
 May
 this
year,
 sources
 close
 to
 Finance
 Minister
 Edouard
 Balladur
 said.

 
 
 
 Although
 the
 Finance
 Ministry
 simply
 said
 that
 the
 group
would
 be
 privatised
 during
 the
 course
 of
 this
 year,
 when
 it
first
 announced
 the
 operation
 in
 early
 January,
 the
 May
 date
 is
earlier
 than
 the
 market
 had
 expected.

 
 
 
 As
 a
 result
 it
 will
 follow
 close
 on
 the
 heels
 of
 the
privatisation
 of
 the
 TF1
 television
 channel
 and
 the
 advertising
group
 &lt;Agence
 Havas>.

 
 
 
 Last
 month
 the
 government
 privatised
 the
 first
 of
 the
 state
financial
 groups,
 Cie
 Financiere
 de
 Paribas
 &lt;PARI.P>,
 in
 a
floatation
 which
 was
 40
 times
 oversubscribed.

 
 
 
 And
 in
 December
 the
 first
 of
 the
 industrial
 groups,
 glass
maker
 Cie
 de
 Saint-Gobain
 &lt;SGEP.P>,
 returned
 to
 the
 private
sector.

 
 
 
 CGE
 has
 interests
 ranging
 from
 telecommunications
 to
shipbuilding
 and
 nuclear
 engineering,
 and
 recently
 struck
 a
deal
 with
 ITT
 Corp
 &lt;ITT.N>
 to
 create
 the
 world's
 second
 largest
telecommunications
 group
 under
 the
 Alcatel

 The

 has
 given
 itself
 until
 the
 end

 to
 decide
 which

 be
 accepted,
 they
 added.

 
 
 
 While
 several

 have
 said
 they
 want
 to
 gain
 a

 in
 the

 their
 potential

 20

 under

 The

 with

 A

 which
 hopes
 to

in
 CGCT,
 with
 the
 French

taking
 the
 remaining
 80

 has
 also
 submitted
 a

 for
 the

<TITLE>SPEAKER
 SEEKING
 SUPPORT
 FOR
 U.S.
 TAX
 INCREASES</TITLE>
<BODY>House
 Speaker
 Jim
 Wright
 is
 lobbying
congressmen
 to
 support
 a
 plan
 to
 cut
 the
 1988
 budget
 deficit
about
 40
 billion
 dlrs,
 half
 through
 spending
 cuts
 and
 the
remainder
 through
 tax
 hikes,
 congressional
 sources
 said.

 
 
 
 He
 is
 backing
 a
 half
 and
 half
 plan
 and
 has
 made
 the
suggestion
 to
 Democrats
 on
 the
 House
 Budget
 Committee
privately,
 committee
 sources
 said.

 
 
 
 However,
 a
 committee
 source
 told
 Reuters
 that
 committee
Democrats
 already
 generally
 favor
 a
 plan
 to
 cut
 the
 deficit
about
 40
 billion
 dlrs,
 half
 through
 taxes
 and
 the
 Speaker's
move
 was
 seen
 as
 building
 support
 outside
 the
 committee.

 
 
 
 Wright's
 20
 billion
 dlr
 revenue
 raising
 plan
 has
 no
specifics,
 although
 he
 has
 floated
 a
 stock
 transfer
 tax
 and
also
 has
 suggested
 deferring
 tax
 cuts
 due
 to
 the
 wealthy.

 
 
 
 Neither
 of
 those
 plans
 has
 caught
 fire
 yet
 in
 Congress,
 and
some
 congressmen
 are
 cool
 to
 the
 idea
 of
 a
 stock
 tax.

 
 
 
 The
 Budget
 committee
 is
 considering
 a
 1988
 budget
 aimed
 at
reducing
 the
 estimated
 deficit
 of
 170
 billion
 dlrs
 as
 estimated
by
 the
 nonpartisan
 Congressional
 Budget
 Office.

 
 
 
 Committee
 Chairman
 William
 Gray
 has
 publicly
 backed
 a
budget
 cutting
 move
 of
 40
 billion
 dlrs
 but
 says
 that
 will
 not
reach
 the
 Gramm-Rudman
 deficit
 target
 for
 1988
 of
 108
 billion
dlrs,
 although
 he
 claims
 it
 will
 be
 in

 In

 the
 dramatic

 of
 its
 1986
 sales
 of
 14.94
 billion
 dlrs
 from
 its
 oil
and
 gas
 operations.

 
 
 
 About
 24
 pct
 of
 total
 sales
 came
 from
 USX's
 USS
 steel
 unit
and
 16
 pct
 from
 diversified
 businesses,
 which
 include
 oilfield
services,
 raw
 materials,
 minerals,
 chemicals
 and
 real
 estate.

 
 
 
 According
 to
 the
 report,
 domestic
 liquids
 reserves
 fell
slightly
 to
 628.5
 mln
 barrels
 from
 628.9
 mln
 and
 foreign
reserves
 fell
 to
 174.3
 mln
 from
 486.4
 mln
 barrels.
 The
 large
drop
 in
 foreign
 reserves
 was
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 and
 Africa,
where
 they
 fell
 to
 about
 9.3
 mln
 barrels
 from
 316.7
 mln,
reflecting
 the
 exclusion
 of
 Libya.

 
 
 
 Total
 natural
 gas
 reserves
 fell
 to
 4.82
 trillion
 cubic
 feet
at
 year-end
 1986
 from
 5.18
 trillion
 at
 the
 end
 of
 1985.

 
 
 
 Again,
 most
 of
 the
 drop
 came
 from
 the
 Middle
 East
 and
Africa,
 where
 reserves
 fell
 to
 zero
 from
 71.9
 billion
 cubic
feet,
 excluding
 Libyan
 reserves.

 
 
 
 U.S.
 natural
 gas
 reserves
 fell
 to
 3.44
 trillion
 cubic
 feet
from
 3.65
 trillion
 and
 foreign
 reserves
 fell
 to
 1.38
 trillion
from
 1.53
 trillion.

 
 
 
 In
 other
 areas,
 USX
 said
 total
 capital
 spending
 fell
 to
 962
mln
 dlrs
 in
 1986
 from
 1.78
 billion
 dlrs
 in
 1985.
 The
 1986
audited
 figure
 is
 eight
 mln
 dlrs
 higher
 than
 the
 unaudited
figure
 the
 company
 reported
 on
 Jan
 27.

 
 
 
 USX
 also
 said
 it
 expects
 to
 record
 a
 gain
 of
 150
 mln
 dlrs
in
 1988,
 representing
 50
 pct
 of
 previously
 existing
 investment
tax
 credits
 allowable
 under
 the
 new
 tax
 law.
 The
 loss
 of
 the
other
 half
 of
 the
 credits
 was
 reflected
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter.

 
 
 
 In
 a
 discussion
 of
 steel
 results,
 USX
 said
 plants
 that
 were
shut
 down
 last
 month
 and
 some
 previously
 idled
 plants
 may
 be
permanently
 closed.
 USX
 took
 a
 fourth
 quarter
 charge
 of
 1.03
billion
 dlrs
 to
 restructure
 its
 steel
 operations.
 The
 charge
included
 the
 "indefinite
 idling"
 last
 month
 of
 four
 plants
 in
Utah,
 Pennsylvania
 and
 Texas.

 
 
 
 Other
 plants
 or
 parts
 of
 plants
 in
 Pennsylvania,
 Indiana,
Alabama,
 Ohio
 and
 Chicago
 had
 been
 previously
 idled.

 
 
 
 "These
 operations
 are
 not
 permanently
 shut
 down.
 Improved
market
 conditions
 for
 the
 products
 from
 these
 plants
 may
 make
it
 feasible
 to
 reopen
 some
 of
 them,"
 USX
 said
 in
 the
 report.

 
 
 
 "On
 the
 other
 hand,
 a
 lack
 of
 any
 future
 market
 improvement
may
 necessitate
 their
 permanent
 closing,"
 it
 added.

<TITLE>PHILLIPS&lt;P>
 SAYS
 STOCK
 UP
 ON
 STEPS
 TO
 PARE
 DEBT</TITLE>
<BODY>Phillips
 Petroleum
 Co
 Chairman
 C.
 J.
"Pete"
 Silas
 said
 his
 company's
 stock,
 ranked
 fourth
 on
 the
most
 active
 list
 of
 stocks
 traded
 today,
 rose
 partly
 because
 of
steps
 it
 took
 to
 pare
 its
 debt.

 
 
 
 Silas
 told
 Reuters
 in
 an
 interview
 today,
 "part
 of
 this
strength
 results
 from
 the
 rise
 in
 oil
 prices
 and
 also
 because
some
 of
 the
 analysts
 have
 been
 happy
 with
 the
 steps
 we've
 taken
in
 1986
 to
 pare
 our
 debt."

 
 
 
 Phillips
 stocks
 rose
 1/4
 to
 14
 dlrs
 a
 share
 following
recommendations
 by
 some
 oil
 analysts,
 a
 company
 source
 said.

 
 
 
 Phillips
 debt
 stood
 at
 5.9
 billion
 dlrs
 in
 December
 1986
down
 from
 a
 1985
 high
 of
 8.6
 billion
 dlrs,
 analysts
 said.

 
 
 
 "At
 14
 dlrs
 a
 share,
 Phillips
 is
 priced
 closer
 to
 the
 actual
price
 of
 oil,"
 he
 added.

 
 
 
 Silas
 said,
 "if
 the
 analysts
 are
 right
 that
 oil
 prices
 will
rise
 to
 20
 dlrs
 or
 higher,
 then
 it
 seems
 to
 make
 sense
 to
 buy
Phillips."
 He
 is,
 however,
 more
 cautious
 about
 the
 strength
 in
crude
 prices,
 expecting
 the
 price
 to
 fluctuate
 between
 16-18
dlrs
 a
 barrel
 for
 the
 year.

 
 
 
 Oil
 industry
 analysts
 said
 one
 reason
 for
 the
 stock's
popularity
 of
 the
 stock
 is
 that
 it
 traded
 at
 a
 strong
 discount
to
 its
 appraised
 value
 and
 was
 attractively
 priced
 for
 small
investors.

 
 
 
 Charles
 Andrew,
 an
 analyst
 who
 follows
 Phillips
 for
 John
 S.
Herold
 Inc
 of
 Greenwich,
 Conn
 said
 that
 the
 appraised
 value
 of
the
 company,
 based
 on
 available
 data
 is
 34.25
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 "The
 stock
 is
 trading
 at
 about
 1/3
 its
 appraised
 value.
 The
company
 has
 tremendous
 leverage
 and
 if
 it
 can
 get
 its
 act
together
 and
 if
 oil
 prices
 are
 steady
 to
 higher
 there
 is
 good
room
 for
 improvement,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 But,
 he
 added,
 "if
 oil
 prices
 turn
 lower,
 there
 will
 be
 a
lot
 of
 pressure
 on
 Phillips."

 
 
 Phillips'
 shares
 fell
 as
 low
 as
 eight
 dlrs
 a
 share
 over
 the
last
 52
 weeks
 with
 a
 1987
 low
 of
 11-3/4
 dlrs
 in
 1987.
 
 
 
Analysts
 say
 that
 the
 appraised
 value
 of
 the
 company
 could
 be
revised
 due
 to
 asset
 sales
 of
 their
 oil
 and
 gas
 reserves.

 
 
 Silas
 told
 Reuters
 that
 the
 asset
 sales
 which
 amount
 to
about
 two
 billion
 dlrs
 for
 1986
 were
 completed
 and
 that
 none
were
 planned.

 The

 1.80

 a

 if
 the
 full

It
 said
 it

ended
 January
 31
 fell
 to
 273,000

 For

 posted
 an

 of
 4.4

 also
 posted

 rose

 The

 The

 in
 a

 said
 it
 has
started
 a

 for
 all
 Piedmont

 at
 that

and
 the
 Piedmont
 board,
 with
 two
 directors
 absent,
 has
unanimously
 approved
 the
 bid.
 
 The
 offer
 and
 withdrawal
 rights
are
 to
 expire
 April
 Three
 unless
 extended,
 and
 the
 bid
 is
 to
 be
followed
 by
 a
 merger
 at
 the
 same
 price.

 
 
 
 USAir
 said
 Piedmont
 has
 granted
 it
 an
 irrevocable
 option
 to
buy
 up
 to
 3,491,030
 new
 shares
 under
 certain
 circumstances.
Piedmont
 now
 has
 about
 18.6
 mln
 shares
 outstanding.

 
 
 
 USAir
 said
 the
 tender
 is
 conditioned
 on
 receipt
 of
 enough
shares
 to
 give
 USAir
 at
 least
 a
 50.1
 pct
 interest
 in
 Piedmont
on
 a
 fully
 diluted
 basis
 and
 approval
 by
 the
 U.S.
 Department
 of
Transportation
 of
 a
 voting
 trust
 agreement
 permitting
 USAir
 to
buy
 and
 hold
 shares
 pending
 review
 of
 its
 application
 to
 gain
control
 of
 Piedmont.

 
 
 
 The
 company
 said
 its
 merger
 agreement
 with
 Piedmont
provides
 that
 the
 offer
 is
 not
 to
 be
 amended
 without
 Piedmont's
prior
 written
 consent
 in
 any
 way
 that
 would
 be
 adverse
 to
Piedmont
 shareholders,
 but
 it
 said
 it
 could
 cut
 the
 number
 of
shares
 to
 be
 bought
 without
 Piedmont's
 consent.

 
 
 
 USAir
 said
 it
 could
 reduce
 the
 number
 of
 Piedmont
 shares
 to
be
 purchased
 in
 the
 offer
 to
 no
 less
 than
 the
 minimum
 number
needed
 to
 cause
 the
 voting
 trust
 condition
 of
 the
 bid
 to
 be
satisfied.

 
 
 
 In
 that
 case,
 it
 said
 if
 more
 than
 that
 minimum
 number
 of
shares
 were
 tendered,
 it
 would
 buy
 shares
 on
 a
 pro

 basis.

 
 
 
 In

 USAir

 for
 50

 of
 Piedmont's

 and
 1.55

 for
 each
 remaining
 Piedmont

 Last

 The

 SLOWING
 IN

<BODY>The
 24
 nations
 of
 the
 Organisation
 for
Economic
 Cooperation
 and
 Development
 (OECD),
 hampered
 by
sluggish
 industrial
 output
 and
 trade,
 face
 slower
 economic
growth,
 and
 their
 joint
 balance
 of
 payments
 will
 swing
 into
deficit
 in
 1987,
 the
 Economist
 Intelligence
 Unit
 (EIU
 )
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 EIU
 said
 in
 its
 World
 Trade
 Forecast
 it
 revised
 OECD
economic
 growth
 downwards
 to
 2.5
 pct
 this
 year,
 compared
 with
 a
2.8
 pct
 growth
 forecast
 in
 December.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 the
 new
 areas
 of
 weakness
 are
 West
 Germany
 and
 the
smaller
 European
 countries
 it
 influences,
 and
 Japan,
 hardest
hit
 by
 currency
 appreciation
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 The
 independent
 research
 organisation
 cut
 its
 1987
 growth
rate
 forecasts
 for
 West
 Germany
 to
 2.2
 pct
 from
 3.2
 pct
 in
December
 and
 to
 2.3
 pct
 from
 three
 pct
 for
 Japan.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 it
 expected
 the
 OECD
 to
 post
 a
 current
 account
deficit
 of
 some
 13
 billion
 dlrs
 in
 both
 1987
 and
 1988,
 due
 in
large
 part
 to
 a
 1.50
 dlrs
 a
 barrel
 rise
 in
 1987
 oil
 prices.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 the
 U.S.
 Current
 account
 deficit
 looked
 likely
 to
fall
 even
 more
 slowly
 than
 forecast,
 to
 125
 billion
 dlrs
 in
1987
 and
 115
 billion
 in
 1988
 from
 130
 billion
 in
 1986.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 it
 expected
 West
 Germany
 to
 post
 a
 31
 billion
 dlr
payments
 surplus
 and
 Japan
 a
 76
 billion
 dlr
 surplus
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 The
 EIU
 said
 it
 saw
 oil
 prices
 dropping
 to
 around
 16.50
dlrs
 a
 barrel
 by
 end-1987
 and
 15.50
 dlrs
 in
 1988
 from
 about
 18
dlrs
 last
 year,
 as
 adherence
 to
 OPEC
 output
 policy
 becomes
increasingly
 ragged.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 the
 dollar
 is
 poised
 to
 resume
 its
 decline
 in
foreign
 exchange
 markets,
 and
 will
 lose
 a
 further
 13
 pct
 on
 its
trade-weighted
 index
 this
 year
 and
 five
 pct
 in
 1988
 after
 last
year's
 18.4
 pct
 drop.
 The
 average
 mark/dollar
 rate
 is
 put
 at
1.80
 marks
 this
 year
 and
 1.70
 in
 1988
 while
 the
 yen/dollar
 rate
is
 expected
 to
 break
 through
 the
 150
 yen
 barrier
 with
 an
average
 value
 of
 150
 yen
 in
 1987
 and
 146
 yen
 in
 1988,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 "This
 is
 not
 a
 crash
 scenario
 but
 the
 dollar's
 steeper
angle
 of
 descent
 increases
 the
 risk
 of
 ending
 with
 a
 fireball
rather
 than
 a
 three-point
 landing,"
 the
 EIU
 said.

 
 
 
 "Talking
 will
 not
 stop
 the
 dollar's
 slide
 for
 long
 and
 the
February
 meeting
 (of
 finance
 ministers
 of
 the
 Group
 of
 Five
 and
Canada)
 produced
 scant
 promise
 of
 either
 a
 decisive
 shift
 to
more
 expansive
 policies
 in
 West
 Germany
 and
 Japan,
 or
 a
 tighter
U.S.
 Fsical
 policy,"
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 the
 key
 to
 the
 dollar's
 fortunes
 was
 the
willingness
 of
 Japanese
 institutions
 to
 buy
 U.S.
 Government
assets
 despite
 prospects
 of
 sustaining
 a
 currency
 loss.

 
 
 
 "Thus
 far
 they
 have
 been
 willing,"
 the
 EIC
 said,
 adding
that
 if
 Japan
 was
 deterred
 from
 buying
 U.S.
 bonds
 the
 dollar
would
 collapse.

 
 
 
 To
 contain
 such
 a
 currency
 crisis,
 dollar
 interest
 rates
would
 have
 to
 soar,
 bringing
 recession
 and
 a
 Third
 World
 debt
crisis,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 On
 trade,
 the
 EIU
 said
 prospects
 for
 1987
 look
"increasingly
 sick."

 
 
 
 Import
 growth,
 forecast
 in
 December
 at
 4.5
 pct,
 is
 now
 seen
slowing
 down
 to
 around
 3.8
 pct
 in
 1987
 with
 a
 recovery
 only
 to
4.2
 pct
 in
 1988,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 weakness
 of
 the
 West
 German
 economy
 is
 the
 biggest
single
 factor,
 with
 import
 growth
 there
 expected
 to
 feature
 a
sluggish
 3.5
 pct
 growth
 in
 1987
 against
 the
 6.5
 pct
 forecast
 in
December,
 the
 EIU
 said.

 
 
 
 On
 the
 export
 side,
 it
 said
 it
 saw
 weak
 demand
 in
 West
Germany
 affecting
 export
 prospects
 elsewhere
 in
 Europe,
 while
Japan's
 exports
 in
 1987
 would
 remain
 flat
 and
 sales
 by
 U.S.
Exporters
 would
 respond
 only
 marginally
 to
 a
 lower,
 more
competitively-priced
 dollar.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 in
 most
 of
 Europe
 and
 in
 Japan,
 raw
 materials
 and
oil
 will
 cost
 less
 in
 domestic
 currency
 in
 1987
 than
 in
 1986.

<TITLE>POEHL
 SAYS
 FURTHER
 RATE
 CUT
 POSSIBLE
 -
 SOURCES</TITLE>
<BODY>Bundesbank
 president
 Karl
 Otto
 Poehl
told
 a
 closed
 investment
 symposium
 that
 West
 Germany
 could
 cut
leading
 interest
 rates
 again
 if
 the
 United
 States
 makes
 a
similar
 move,
 banking
 sources
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 sources
 were
 reporting
 Poehl's
 remarks
 at
 a
 symposium
in
 Duesseldorf
 last
 week
 organised
 by
 Deutsche
 Bank
 Ag.
 Press
representatives
 were
 not
 invited.

 
 
 
 The
 sources,
 speaking
 separately,
 said
 Poehl
 told
 about
 200
bankers
 in
 reply
 to
 questions
 that
 a
 cut
 in
 U.S.
 Interest
 rates
would
 give
 room
 for
 a
 matching
 measure
 in
 Germany.

 
 
 
 "It
 was
 a
 definite
 hint
 at
 lower
 German
 interest
 rates,"
 said
one
 banker
 who
 attended
 the
 symposium.

 
 
 
 A
 Bundesbank
 spokesman
 said
 the
 central
 bank
 would
 have
 no
comment
 on
 the
 reported
 remarks,
 made
 at
 the
 private
 meeting.

 
 
 
 But,
 according
 to
 a
 second
 source,
 who
 also
 declined
 to
 be
identified,
 Poehl's
 comments
 were
 seen
 by
 bankers
 present
 as
 a
direct
 pointer
 to
 further
 moves
 by
 the
 central
 bank
 to
 defend
German
 industry
 from
 an
 additional
 revaluation
 of
 the
 mark.

 
 
 
 "He
 said
 if
 the
 Americans
 drop
 their
 interest
 rates
 then
 the
Bundesbank
 would
 also
 drop
 them.
 He
 said
 that
 quite
 clearly,"
the
 second
 source
 said.

 
 
 
 In
 reply
 to
 questions,
 Poehl
 also
 said
 the
 half-point
 cut
in
 the
 discount
 and
 Lombard
 rates
 on
 January
 22
 came
 after
 the
U.S.
 Had
 signalled
 it
 would
 be
 prepared
 to
 attend
 a
 meeting
 to
discuss
 the
 level
 of
 the
 dollar
 on
 condition
 Germany
 made
 such
a
 move
 in
 advance,
 the
 sources
 said.

 
 
 
 Asked
 if
 American
 authorities
 could
 have
 been
 persuaded,
 by
cuts
 in
 German
 rates,
 to
 come
 to
 the
 bargaining
 table
 as
 early
as
 last
 September,
 one
 of
 the
 sources
 quoted
 Poehl
 as
 saying,
"No,
 they
 wouldn't
 have
 been.
 We
 checked
 that."

 
 
 
 The
 Paris
 meeting
 of
 the
 Group
 of
 Six
 industrial
 nations
took
 place
 exactly
 one
 month
 after
 the
 German
 cut
 in
 rates.

 
 
 
 Poehl
 emphasised
 in
 his
 comments
 the
 very
 close
 talks
between
 central
 banks
 before
 and
 after
 the
 G-6
 meeting,
 saying
that
 financial
 markets
 had
 not
 fully
 realised
 the
 significance
of
 the
 Paris
 session
 and
 the
 U.S.
 Agreement
 to
 stem
 further
falls
 in
 the
 value
 of
 the
 dollar,
 the
 sources
 said.

 
 
 
 For
 the
 first
 time
 all
 participants
 at
 the
 summit
 agreed
that
 a
 further
 fall
 in
 the
 dollar
 would
 be
 harmful
 for
 all
world
 economies,
 including
 the
 U.S.,
 Poehl
 had
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 sources
 said
 the
 tone
 of
 Poehl's
 comments
 boosted
growing
 sentiment
 that
 the
 dollar
 would
 be
 stabilised
 around
current
 levels
 by
 international
 central
 bank
 cooperation.

 
 
 
 One
 source
 said
 Poehl's
 remarks
 also
 underlined
 the
 fact
that
 the
 Bundesbank
 was
 now
 more
 prepared
 to
 be
 accommodative
in
 monetary
 policy
 in
 order
 to
 prevent
 a
 further
 slowdown
 in
West
 Germany's
 economic
 growth.

 
 
 
 Poehl
 and
 other
 Bundesbank
 officials
 have
 in
 the
 past
stressed
 that
 the
 German
 central
 bank
 had
 no
 direct
responsibility
 for
 growth
 and
 was
 solely
 concerned
 with
combatting
 inflation.

 
 
 
 This
 led,
 for
 instance,
 to
 the
 introduction
 of
 a
 tighter
monetary
 stance
 from
 the
 beginning
 of
 December
 until
 the
half-point
 cut
 in
 rates
 in
 late
 January.

 
 
 
 The
 sources
 quoted
 Poehl
 as
 saying
 that
 the
 current
overshooting
 of
 the
 German
 monetary
 target
 would
 not
 directly
respark
 inflation.
 The
 Bundesbank
 was
 not
 obliged
 to
 react
immediately
 whenever
 such
 overshooting
 occurs.

 
 
 
 Latest
 data
 for
 central
 bank
 money
 stock,
 the
 Bundesbank's
main
 measure
 of
 money
 supply,
 showed
 the
 measure
 was
 growing
 at
7-1/2
 pct
 in
 January,
 outside
 its
 three
 to
 six
 pct
 1987
 target.

 
 
 
 Share
 prices
 rose
 in
 very
 active
 trading
 today,
 with
dealers
 reporting
 that
 Poehl's
 remarks,
 coupled
 with
 a
 bullish
outlook
 on
 stock
 prices
 from
 Deutsche
 at
 the
 same
 symposium,
brought
 in
 strong
 bargain
 hunting
 at
 current
 low
 levels.

<BODY>The

 rescheduling
accord
 Venezuela
 signed
 a

 will
 reduce
 its
 payments
over
 the

 three
 years
 by
 64
 pct,
 according
 to
 Finance
Ministry
 figures
 released
 this
 weekend.

 
 
 
 A

 statistical
 analysis
 said
 while
 the
 original
accord
 called
 for
 payments
 of
 3.82
 billion
 dlrs
 between
 1987
and
 1989,
 the
 new
 agreement
 requires
 debt
 servicing
 of
 1.35
billion
 over
 the
 same
 period.
 In
 1987,
 Venezuela
 will
 be
required
 to
 pay
 250
 mln
 dlrs
 instead
 of
 the
 1.55
 billion
originally
 agreed.
 Payments
 in
 1988
 were
 cut
 to
 400
 mln
 from
1.20
 billion,
 and
 in
 1989
 to
 700
 mln
 from
 1.11
 billion.

 
 
 
 The
 ministry's
 analysis
 said
 the
 reduction
 in
 debt
servicing
 during
 1987-1989
 amounts
 to
 an
 effective
 grace
period,
 something
 the
 Venezuelan
 negotiators
 sought
 from
creditor
 banks
 but
 were
 not
 granted.

 
 
 
 Most
 of
 the
 rescheduling
 falls
 during
 1994-1998,
 when
 53.3
pct,
 or
 some
 11.25
 billion
 dlrs,
 must
 be
 paid.
 Under
 the
February
 27

 Venezuela
 will

 debt
 over
 14
 years
 at
 7/8
 of
 a
 percentage
 point
over
 London
 interbank
 offered

 (Libor).

 
 
 
 This
 compares
 with
 the

 BURDEN

 TAIWAN,
 KOREA</TITLE>
<BODY>Responsibility
 for
 the
 appreciation
 of
the
 Taiwan
 dollar
 and
 the
 South
 Korean
 Won
 lies
 soley
 with
those
 countries,
 said
 U.S.
 trade
 representative
 Clayton
 Yeutter

 
 
 
 Speaking
 to
 the
 Asia
 Society,
 Yeutter
 said
 that
 it
 is
 in
those
 countries'
 own
 long-term
 interest
 to
 raise
 the
 value
 of
their
 currencies
 against
 the
 dollar.

 
 
 
 Yeutter
 was
 responding
 to
 a
 question
 about
 what
 the
 U.S.
could
 do
 to
 encourage
 appreciation
 of
 those
 currencies
 against
the
 dollar
 in
 order
 to
 reduce
 the
 large
 U.S.
 trade
 deficits
with
 Taiwain
 and
 Korea.

 
 
 
 "An
 undervalued
 currency
 will
 help
 those
 countries'
 exports
in
 the
 short
 term,
 but
 in
 the
 long
 run
 they
 have
 to
 be
concerned
 about
 how
 they
 are
 perceived
 in
 the
 international
business
 community,"
 Yeutter
 said.

 
 
 
 For
 Taiwan,
 Yeutter
 said
 that
 with
 its
 per
 capita
 trade
surplus
 with
 the
 U.S.,
 much
 larger
 than
 that
 of
 Japan's,
 and
with
 huge
 foreign
 exchange
 reserves,
 it
 was
 difficult
 to
 defend
the
 high
 import
 tarrifs
 and
 other
 barriers
 that
 prevail
 in
 that
country.

 
 
 
 He
 also
 said
 that
 the
 south
 Korean
 Won
 should
 begin
 to
 move
to
 reflect
 underlying
 economic
 fundamentals,
 "otherwise
 in
 two
or
 three
 years'
 time,
 Korea
 will
 be
 in
 the
 same
 situation
 that
prevails
 in
 Taiwan."

 
 
 
 Turning
 to
 the
 U.S.
 deficit
 with
 Japan
 of
 more
 than
 50
billion
 dlrs,
 Yeutter
 said
 that
 this
 situation
 was
 not
sustainable.

 
 
 
 "Something
 must
 give
 soon.
 If
 not,
 there
 is
 a
 great
 threat
of
 U.S.
 legislative
 action
 to
 counteract
 that
 trend,"
 Yeutter
said.

<TITLE>UNILEVER
 HAS
 IMPROVED
 MARGINS,
 VOLUMES
 IN
 1986</TITLE>
<BODY>Unilever
 Plc
 &lt;UN.A>
 and
 NV
 group
 reported
improvements
 in
 margins
 and
 underlying
 sales
 volume
 growth
 of
five
 pct
 in
 1986
 after
 stripping
 out
 the
 effects
 of
 falling
prices,
 disposals
 and
 currency
 movements,
 Unilever
 Plc
 chairman
Michael
 Angus
 said.

 
 
 
 He
 told
 reporters
 that
 volumes
 in
 North
 America
 increased
some
 10.5
 pct
 while
 European
 consumer
 goods
 rose
 about
 2.5
 pct
after
 being
 flat
 for
 some
 years.

 
 
 
 Much
 of
 the
 disposal
 strategy,
 aimed
 at
 concentrating
activities
 on
 core
 businesses,
 had
 now
 been
 completed,
 he
noted.

 
 
 
 But
 the
 process
 of
 acquisitions
 would
 go
 on,
 with
 strategic
acquisitions
 taking
 place
 "from
 time
 to
 time,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 company
 earlier
 reported
 a
 20
 pct
 rise
 in
 pre-tax
profits
 for
 1986
 to
 1.14
 billion
 stg
 from
 953
 mln
 previously.
In
 guilder
 terms,
 however,
 profits
 at
 the
 pre-tax
 level
 dropped
three
 pct
 to
 3.69
 billion
 from
 3.81
 billion.

 
 
 
 Angus
 said
 the
 recent
 purchase
 of
 Chesebrough-Pond's
 Inc
&lt;CBM.N>
 for
 72.50
 dlrs
 a
 share
 was
 unlikely
 to
 bring
 any
earnings
 dilution.

 
 
 
 However,
 it
 would
 not
 add
 much
 to
 profits,
 with
 much
 of
 the
company's
 operating
 profits
 paying
 for
 the
 acquisition
 costs.

 
 
 
 Finance
 director
 Niall
 Fitzgerald
 added
 that
 while
 gearing
-
 debt
 to
 equity
 plus
 debt
 -
 rose
 to
 about
 60
 pct
 at
 end
 1986
from
 35
 pct
 last
 year,
 this
 was
 expected
 to
 drop
 back
 to
 about
40
 pct
 by
 end-1987.

 
 
 
 The
 same
 divergence
 was
 made
 in
 full
 year
 dividend,
 with
Unilever
 NV's
 rising
 3.4
 pct
 to
 15.33
 guilders
 and
 Unilever
Plc's
 increasing
 29.9
 pct
 to
 50.17p,
 approximately
 in
 line
 with
the
 change
 in
 attributable
 profit.

 
 
 
 Angus
 said
 the
 prospectus
 for
 the
 sale
 of
 parts
 of
Chesebrough
 was
 due
 to
 be
 published
 shortly.
 However,
 he
 said
that
 there
 was
 no
 target
 date
 for
 completing
 the
 process.

 
 
 
 He
 also
 declined
 to
 say
 what
 sort
 of
 sum
 Unilever
 hoped
 to
realise
 from
 the
 operation,
 beyond
 noting
 that
 Chesebrough
 had
paid
 around
 1.25
 billion
 dlrs
 for
 Stauffer
 Chemical
 Co,
 which
operates
 outside
 Unilever's
 core
 activities.

 
 
 
 In
 the
 U.S.,
 Organic
 growth
 from
 the
 Lipton
 Foods
 business,
considerable
 expansion
 in
 the
 household
 products
 business
 and
in
 margarine
 had
 been
 behind
 the
 overall
 sales
 increase.

 
 
 
 However,
 he
 noted
 that
 the
 U.S.
 Household
 products
 business
had
 turned
 in
 a
 planned
 loss,
 with
 fourth
 quarter
 performance
better
 than
 expected
 despite
 the
 anticipated
 heavy
 launch
 costs
of
 its
 Surf
 detergents.

<TITLE>CHINA
 CALLS
 FOR
 BETTER
 TRADE
 DEAL
 WITH
 U.S.</TITLE>
<BODY>China
 called
 on
 the
 United
 States
 to
remove
 curbs
 on
 its
 exports,
 to
 give
 it
 favourable
 trading
status
 and
 ease
 restrictions
 on
 exports
 of
 high
 technology.

 
 
 
 But
 the
 U.S.
 Embassy
 replied
 that
 Chinese
 figures
 showing
13
 years
 of
 trade
 deficits
 with
 the
 U.S.
 Out
 of
 the
 last
 15
 are
inaccurate
 and
 said
 Peking
 itself
 would
 have
 to
 persuade
Congress
 to
 change
 laws
 which
 limit
 its
 exports.

 
 
 
 The
 official
 International
 Business
 newspaper
 today
published
 China's
 demands
 in
 a
 
 editorial
 to
 coincide
 with
 the
visit
 of
 U.S.
 Secretary
 of
 State
 George
 Shultz.

 
 
 
 "It
 is
 extremely
 important
 that
 the
 U.S.
 Market
 reduce
 its
restrictions
 on
 Chinese
 imports,
 provide
 the
 needed
 facilities
for
 them
 and
 businessmen
 from
 both
 sides
 help
 to
 expand
 Chinese
exports,"
 the
 editorial
 said.

 
 
 
 "The
 U.S.
 Should
 quickly
 discard
 its
 prejudice
 against
favourable
 tariff
 treatment
 for
 Chinese
 goods
 and
 admit
 China
into
 the
 Generalised
 System
 of
 Preference
 (GSP).

 
 
 
 "Despite
 easing
 of
 curbs
 on
 U.S.
 Technology
 exports
 in
recent
 years,
 control
 of
 them
 is
 still
 extremely
 strict
 and
influences
 normal
 trade
 between
 the
 two
 countries,"
 it
 added.

 
 
 
 The
 paper
 also
 printed
 an
 article
 by
 China's
 commercial
counsellor
 in
 its
 Washington
 embassy,
 Chen
 Shibiao,
 who
 said
that
 "all
 kinds
 of
 difficulties
 and
 restrictions"
 were
 preventing
bilateral
 trade
 fulfilling
 its
 full
 potential.

 
 
 
 He
 named
 them
 as
 U.S.
 Protectionist
 behaviour,
 curbs
 on
technology
 transfer
 and
 out-of-date
 trade
 legislation.

<TITLE>GAO
 LIKELY
 TO
 SHOW
 CERTS
 MORE
 COSTLY
 THAN
 CASH</TITLE>
<BODY>A
 study
 on
 grain
 certificates
 due
 out
shortly
 from
 the
 Government
 Accounting
 Office
 (GAO)
 could
 show
that
 certificates
 cost
 the
 government
 10
 to
 15
 pct
 more
 than
cash
 outlays,
 administration
 and
 industry
 sources
 said.

 
 
 
 Analysis
 that
 the
 GAO
 has
 obtained
 from
 the
 Agriculture
Department
 and
 the
 Office
 of
 Management
 and
 Budget
 suggests
that
 certificates
 cost
 more
 than
 cash
 payments,
 a
 GAO
 official
told
 Reuters.

 
 
 
 GAO
 is
 preparing
 the
 certificate
 study
 at
 the
 specific
request
 of
 Sen.
 Jesse
 Helms
 (R-N.C.),
 former
 chairman
 of
 the
senate
 agriculture
 committee.

 
 
 
 The
 report,
 which
 will
 focus
 on
 the
 cost
 of
 certificates
compared
 to
 cash,
 is
 scheduled
 to
 be
 released
 in
 mid
 March.

 
 
 
 The
 cost
 of
 certificates,
 said
 the
 GAO
 source,
 depends
 on
the
 program's
 impact
 on
 the
 USDA
 loan
 program.

 
 
 
 If
 GAO
 determines
 that
 certificates
 encourage
 more
 loan
entries
 or
 cause
 more
 loan
 forfeitures,
 then
 the
 net
 cost
 of
the
 program
 would
 go
 up.
 However,
 if
 it
 is
 determined
 that
certificates
 have
 caused
 the
 government
 grain
 stockpile
 to
decrease,
 the
 cost
 effect
 of
 certificates
 would
 be
 less.

 
 
 
 GAO
 will
 not
 likely
 suggest
 whether
 the
 certificates
program
 should
 be
 slowed
 or
 expanded,
 the
 GAO
 official
 said.

 
 
 
 But
 a
 negative
 report
 on
 certificates
 "will
 fuel
 the
 fire
against
 certificates
 and
 weigh
 heavily
 on
 at
 least
 an
 increase
in
 the
 certificate
 program,"
 an
 agricultural
 consultant
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 OMB
 is
 said
 to
 be
 against
 any
 expansion
 of
 the
 program,
while
 USDA
 remains
 firmly
 committed
 to
 it.

<TITLE>Venezuela
 seeks
 'flexibility'
 from

<BODY>venezuela
 is
 seeking
 a
 'constructive
 and
flexible'
 attitude
 from
 its
 creditor
 banks
 in
 current
 talks
 to
reschedule
 21
 billion
 dlrs
 in
 foreign
 debt,
 finance
 minister
manuel
 azpurua
 told
 a
 press
 conference.

 
 
 
 He
 declined
 to
 comment
 on
 meetings
 this
 week
 in
 new
 york
between
 public
 finances
 director
 jorge
 marcano
 and
 venezuela's
13-bank
 advisory
 committee
 except
 to
 say,
 "they
 are
progressing."

 
 
 
 Azpurua
 said
 venezuela
 has
 shown
 solidarity
 with
 brazil's
decision
 to
 suspend
 payments,
 but
 each
 country
 must
 negotiate
according
 to
 its
 own
 interest.

 
 
 
 Asked
 to
 comment
 on
 chile's
 agreement
 with
 its
 creditors
today,
 which
 includes
 an
 interest
 rate
 margin
 of
 one
 pct
 over
libor,
 azpurua
 said
 only,
 "that
 is
 good
 news."

 
 
 
 According
 to
 banking
 sources,
 the
 banks'
 latest
 offer
 to
venezuela
 is
 also
 a
 one
 pct
 margin
 as
 against
 the
 last
february's
 1-1/8
 pct
 rescheduling
 accord
 and
 the
 7/8
 pct
Venezuela
 wants.

 
 
 
 Azpurua
 said
 four
 basic
 elements
 are
 being
 negotiated
 with
the
 banks
 now:
 spread
 reduction,
 deferral
 of
 principal
 payments
due
 in
 1987
 and
 1988,
 lenghtening
 the
 12-1/2
 year
 repayment
schedule,
 and
 debt
 capitalization
 schemes.

 
 
 
 Azpurua
 said
 the
 governent
 plans
 to
 pay
 2.1
 billion
 dlrs
 in
public
 and
 private
 debt
 principal
 this
 year.
 It
 was
 due
 to
amortize
 1.05
 billion
 dlrs
 under
 the
 rescheduling,
 and
 pay
 420
mln
 dlrs
 in
 non-restructured
 principal,
 both
 public
 sector.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 venezuela's
 original
 proposal
 was
 to
 pay
 no
principal
 on
 restructured
 debt
 this
 year,
 but
 is
 now
 insisting
that
 if
 it
 makes
 payments
 they
 be
 compensated
 by
 new
 bank
loans.

 
 
 
 The
 banking
 sources
 said
 the
 committee
 has
 been
 prepared
 to
lower
 amortizations
 to
 around
 400
 mln
 dlrs
 this
 year,
 but
 that
no
 direct
 commitment
 was
 likely
 on
 new
 loans.

 
 
 
 "debtors
 and
 bank
 creditors
 have
 a
 joint
 responsibility
 and
there
 will
 be
 no
 lasting
 solution
 unless
 a
 positive
 flow
 of
financing
 is
 guaranteed,"
 azpurua
 said.

 
 
 
 However,
 he
 appeared
 to
 discard
 earlier
 venezuelan
proposals
 for
 a
 direct
 link
 between
 oil
 income
 and
 debt
payments,
 "because
 circumstances
 change
 too
 quickly."

 
 
 
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 he
 said
 the
 government
 is
 presently
studying
 possible
 mechanisms
 for
 capitlizing
 public
 and
 private
sector
 foreign
 debt,
 based
 on
 experience
 in
 other
 countries.
The
 rules
 would
 be
 published
 by
 the
 finance
 ministry
 and
 the
central
 bank.

 The

 said
 that
 the

 However,

 Lallier

 although
 he

 noted
 that
 EDF

 be
 cautious
 because

<TITLE>U.S.
 HOUSE
 PANEL
 TAKES
 FIRST
 TRADE
 BILL
 VOTES</TITLE>
<BODY>House
 trade
 lawmakers
 took
 their
first
 votes
 on
 measures
 designed
 to
 toughen
 U.S.
 trade
 laws
 but
held
 over
 until
 tomorrow
 the
 most
 difficult
 votes
 on
controversial
 plans
 to
 protect
 American
 industries.

 
 
 
 Meeting
 in
 closed
 session,
 the
 House
 Ways
 and
 Means
 Trade
Subcommittee
 failed
 to
 resolve
 one
 of
 the
 most
 sensitive
 issues
in
 the
 bill--whether
 they
 will
 force
 major
 foreign
 trading
partners
 to
 severely
 cut
 their
 trade
 surpluses
 with
 the
 United
States.

 
 
 
 The
 subcommittee
 is
 considering
 a
 toned-down
 version
 of
Democratic-sponsored
 trade
 legislation
 that
 aims
 to
 open
foreign
 markets
 but
 which
 drops
 last
 year's
 effort
 to
 force
President
 Reagan
 to
 retaliate
 with
 quotas
 or
 tariffs.

 
 
 
 Congressional
 aides
 who
 asked
 not
 to
 be
 identified
 said
 the
lawmakers
 intend
 to
 wrap
 up
 their
 proposals
 tomorrow
 and
 will
consider
 a
 proposal
 to
 mandate
 retaliation
 without
 setting
specific
 trade
 penalties.

 
 
 
 The
 legislation
 faces
 another
 hurdle
 in
 the
 full
 Ways
 and
Means
 Committee
 next
 week
 before
 the
 full
 House
 votes
 on
 it.

 
 
 
 Rep.
 Richard
 Gephardt,
 a
 Missouri
 Democrat
 who
 is
 seeking
his
 party's
 1988
 presidential
 nomination,
 said
 he
 may
 offer
 an
amendment
 to
 call
 for
 reductions
 in
 the
 trade
 surpluses
 of
those
 countries
 with
 barriers
 to
 imports
 of
 U.S.
 goods.

 
 
 
 This
 would
 be
 a
 moderated
 version
 of
 his
 earlier
 plan
 to
force
 a
 mandatory
 ten
 per
 cent
 annual
 cut
 in
 the
 trade
 surplus
with
 the
 United
 States
 by
 Japan,
 South
 Korea,
 Taiwan,
 West
Germany
 and
 other
 countries
 with
 the
 largest
 trade
 imbalances.

 
 
 
 "My
 criteria
 for
 a
 good
 amendment
 sets
 a
 standard
 for
getting
 the
 trade
 deficit
 down,"
 he
 told
 reporters.

 
 
 
 The
 trade
 law
 changes
 are
 to
 become
 part
 of
 a
 major
congressional
 and
 administration
 effort
 to
 turn
 around
 the
record
 U.S.
 trade
 deficit
 of
 169
 billion
 dlrs
 last
 year
 by
opening
 up
 foreign
 markets
 and
 making
 U.S.
 products
 more
competitive.

 
 
 
 House
 Speaker
 James
 Wright,
 a
 Texas
 Democrat,
 said
 again
today
 he
 expects
 the
 full
 House
 will
 approve
 the
 trade
 bill
 by
May
 and
 that
 Reagan
 will
 accept
 the
 final
 congressional
 bill.

 
 
 
 "I
 expect
 whatever
 is
 reported
 (by
 the
 Ways
 and
 Means
Committee)
 will
 pass.
 We
 will
 have
 a
 good
 bill
 and
 an
 effective
bill,"
 he
 told
 reporters.

 
 
 
 The
 comprehensive
 trade
 bill
 will
 include
 work
 by
 other
committees
 to
 ease
 export
 controls
 on
 high
 technology,
 to
 aid
U.S.
 workers
 displaced
 by
 foreign
 competition,
 to
 stimulate
research
 and
 development,
 to
 remove
 foreign
 trade
 barriers
 and
to
 improve
 education
 and
 worker
 training.

 
 
 
 The
 lawmakers
 agreed
 that
 for
 the
 first
 time
 a
 U.S.
industry
 could
 charge
 foreign
 producers
 with
 unfair
 competition
if
 they
 deny
 basic
 worker
 rights
 such
 as
 collective
 bargaining,
safety
 rules
 and
 payment
 of
 a
 minimum
 wage
 appropriate
 to
 the
country's
 economic
 development.

 
 
 
 They
 transferred
 to
 U.S.
 Trade
 Representative
 Clayton
Yeutter
 the
 powers
 now
 held
 by
 Reagan
 to
 decide
 whether
 to
retaliate
 against
 foreign
 violations
 of
 fair
 trade
 rules
 and
whether
 an
 injured
 industry
 deserves
 import
 relief.

 
 
 
 They
 agreed
 to
 make
 it
 easier
 for
 a
 company
 to
 get
temporary
 relief
 from
 import
 competition
 but
 agreed
 the
industry
 should
 provide
 a
 plan
 to
 become
 competitive.

 
 
 
 The
 administration
 has
 not
 announced
 its
 support
 but
Yeutter
 said
 yesterday,
 "I
 am
 cautiously
 optimistic,"
 that
 the
Democratic-led
 House
 will
 come
 up
 with
 an
 acceptable
 bill.

<TITLE>SOVIET
 MINISTER
 SAYS
 TRADE
 BOOST
 UP
 TO
 FRENCH</TITLE>
<BODY>Soviet
 first
 deputy
 prime
 minister
Vsevolod
 Murakhovsky
 said
 at
 the
 end
 of
 a
 brief
 visit
 here
 his
country
 wanted
 to
 boost
 joint
 business
 with
 France,
 but
 that
 a
reduction
 of
 France's
 trade
 deficit
 with
 the
 Soviet
 Union
depended
 on
 the
 French.

 
 
 
 Murakhovsky,
 who
 is
 also
 chairman
 of
 the
 State
Agro-Industrial
 Committee
 (GOSAGROPROM),
 told
 a
 news
 conference
he
 had
 discussed
 a
 variety
 of
 possible
 deals
 with
 French
companies
 Rhone-Poulenc,
 Pechiney
 and
 Imec.

 
 
 
 Declining
 to
 put
 figures
 on
 possible
 contracts
 he
 said
 he
had
 discussed
 plant
 protection
 and
 the
 processing
 of
 highly
sulphuric
 gas
 with
 Rhone-Poulenc,
 packaging
 technology
 for
agricultural
 products
 with
 Pechiney,
 and
 fruit
 and
 vegetable
juice
 processing
 with
 Imec.

 
 
 
 An
 official
 for
 Pechiney
 said
 an
 agreement
 of
 intent
 on
packaging
 could
 be
 signed
 soon,
 but
 could
 not
 give
 any
 other
details.
 The
 other
 two
 companies
 were
 not
 immediately
 available
for
 comment.

 
 
 
 Asked
 whether
 he
 foresaw
 a
 reduction
 this
 year
 of
 France's
trade
 shortfall,
 at
 7.6
 billion
 francs
 in
 the
 first
 11
 months
of
 1986
 against
 5.1
 billion
 for
 the
 whole
 of
 1985,
 Murakhovsky
told
 Reuters:
 "It
 all
 depends
 on
 France."

 
 
 
 At
 a
 meeting
 in
 Paris
 last
 January
 French
 and
 Soviet
foreign
 trade
 ministers
 said
 they
 were
 committed
 to
 increased
efforts
 to
 reduce
 the
 deficit.
 Estimates
 at
 the
 time
 showed
 a
French
 190
 mln
 franc
 surplus
 for
 December
 1986.

 
 
 
 Murakhovsky
 said
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 was
 prepared
 to
 talk
 with
anybody
 with
 "interesting"
 proposals
 offering
 latest
 technology
and
 assuring
 "a
 mutual
 advantage."

 
 
 
 He
 said
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 had
 many
 tasks
 ahead
 of
 it
 and
would
 deal
 rapidly
 with
 proposals
 it
 considered
 interesting.

 
 
 
 He
 encouraged
 companies
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 new
 laws
guaranteeing
 "the
 interests
 of
 foreign
 partners"
 in
 joint
ventures.

 
 
 
 But
 he
 said
 no
 agreements
 had
 yet
 been
 finalised
 under
 the
new
 joint
 venture
 laws.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 concrete
 deals
 had
 not
 yet
 been
 finalised
 as
 a
result
 of
 a
 one
 billion
 dollar
 accord
 signed
 in
 Moscow
 last
month
 with
 French
 businessman
 Jean-Baptiste
 Doumeng.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 Doumeng's
 Interagra
 company
 was
 preparing
 proposals
for
 further
 examination
 by
 the
 Soviet
 Union.
 Doumeng
 last
 month
said
 the
 agreement
 was
 to
 exchange
 one
 billion
 dollars
 worth
 of
goods.

 
 
 
 Murakhovsky
 said
 the
 agreement
 was
 one
 of
 intent,
 and
designed
 primarily
 to
 renew
 and
 increase
 the
 Soviet
 Union's
food
 production
 capacity.

 domestic
 economy,"
 he
 told
 a
 group
 of
 Japanese
businessmen
 in
 London.

 
 
 
 "But
 these
 short
 term
 difficulties
 should
 not
 be
 allowed
 to
deflect
 Japan
 from
 the
 fundamental
 reforms
 necessary,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 "It
 is
 not
 just
 a
 domestic
 issue
 for
 Japan.
 If
 import
propensity
 does
 not
 expand
 very
 soon
 there
 is
 a
 real
 risk
 from
protectionist
 lobbies,
 particularly
 in
 the
 U.S.
 With
 whom
 Japan
has
 so
 massive
 a
 surplus,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 "They
 may
 well
 succeed
 in
 securing
 action
 by
 governments
which
 would
 be
 highly
 injurious
 to
 trading
 nations
 like
 Japan
and
 the
 U.K."

 
 
 
 Channon
 said
 there
 had
 been
 substantial
 growth
 in
 the
volume
 of
 trade
 between
 Japan
 and
 Britain,
 amounting
 to
 6.2
billion
 sterling
 (9.8
 billion
 dlrs)
 last
 year.

 
 
 
 But
 he
 added:
 "Regrettably
 too
 much
 of
 it
 was
 in
 one
direction,
 with
 the
 Japanese
 selling
 us
 3.7
 billion
 sterling
(5.8
 billion
 dlrs)
 more
 than
 we
 sold
 them."

 said
 it
 has
 started
 a

 offer
for
 all
 shares
 of
 Caesars
 World
 Inc
 at
 28
 dlrs
 each.

 
 
 
 In
 a
 newspaper
 advertisement,
 MTS
 said
 the
 offer
 and
withdrawal
 rights
 expire
 April
 Three
 unless
 extended.

 
 
 
 Sosnoff,
 a
 New
 York
 investor,
 already
 owns
 about
 four
 mln
of
 Caesars'
 30.3
 mln
 shares
 outstanding,
 or
 about
 13.3
 pct,
 and
is
 Caesars'
 largest
 shareholder.
 
 Caesars
 owns
 casino
 hotels
 in
Nevada
 and
 honeymoon
 resorts
 in
 Pennsylvania's
 Pocono
Mountains.
 
 It
 also
 controls
 Caesars
 New
 Jersey
 Inc
 &lt;CJN>,
which
 owns
 an
 Atlantic
 City,
 N.J.,
 casino
 hotel.

 
 
 
 For
 the
 second
 quarter
 ended
 January
 31,
 Caesars
 World
earned
 12.6
 mln
 dlrs
 on
 revenues
 of
 190.4
 mln
 dlrs,
 up
 from
earnings
 of
 7,500,000
 dlrs
 and
 revenues
 of
 163.8
 mln
 dlrs
 a
year
 before.
 
 For
 all
 of
 fiscal
 1986,
 the
 company
 earned
 41.0
mln
 dlrs
 on
 revenues
 of
 694.4
 mln
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 MTS
 said
 the
 offer
 is
 conditioned
 on
 receipt
 of
 at
 least
enough
 shares
 to
 give
 Sosnoff
 a
 majority
 interest
 on
 a
 fully
diluted
 basis,
 the
 arrangement
 of
 sufficient
 financing
 to
 buy
all
 Caesars

 not

 and
approval
 by
 the
 New

 Commission
 and
 the
NEvada
 Gaming

 and
 State

 MTS
 said
 Marine
 Midland

 &lt;MM>
 has
 committed
 to
lend
 it
 100
 mln
 dlrs
 for
 the
 acquisition
 and
 use
 its
 best
efforts
 to
 syndicate
 another
 400
 mln
 dlrs
 in
 senior

for
 the
 transaction.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 its

 &lt;PWJ>,
has
 stated
 in

 that
 subject
 to
 market

 it
 is
highly
 confident
 that
 it
 can
 arrange
 commitments
 for
 up
 to
 475

 in

 MTS
 said
 it
 does
 not
 expect
 problems
 in
 obtaining
 New
Jersey
 and
 Nevada
 regulatory
 approval
 for
 the
 acquisition,
since
 ownership
 in
 a
 Caesars
 stake
 has
 already
 been
 cleared.

 
 
 
 In
 June
 1986,
 Sosnoff
 requested
 a
 seat
 on
 the
 Caesars
 World
board,
 a
 request
 that
 has
 not
 yet
 been
 granted.
 
 In
 September
1986,
 Sosnoff,
 who
 is
 chairman
 of
 &lt;Atalanta/Sosnoff
 Capital
Corp>,
 filed
 for
 clearance
 under
 U.S.
 antitrust
 laws
 to
 raise
his
 interest
 in
 Caesars
 World
 to
 25
 pct.

 
 
 
 Sosnoff
 said,
 in
 a
 letter
 to
 Caesars
 World
 chairman
 and
chief
 executive
 officer
 Henry
 Gluck,
 that
 "The
 decision
 to
 go
directly
 to
 the
 shareholders
 was
 made
 at
 the
 urging
 of
 may
financial
 and
 legal
 advisors,
 who
 repeatedly
 stressed
 to
 me
 the
lack
 of
 responsiveness
 of
 the
 management
 in
 the
 past."

 
 
 
 Sosnoff,
 who
 said
 he
 has
 made
 numerous
 efforts
 to
 express
his
 views
 to
 management
 on
 ways
 of
 maximizing
 shareholder
values,
 said
 Caesars
 twicce
 refused
 his
 request
 for
 a
 board
seat.
 
 "My
 advisers
 felt
 that,
 had
 I
 given
 you
 advance
 notice,
you
 would
 have
 used
 the
 time
 to
 throw
 up
 obstacles
 to
 my
 offer
rather
 than
 giving
 it
 serious
 consideration,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 Sosnoff
 said
 he
 hopes
 that
 Caesars
 World
 management
 will
 be
willing
 to
 negotiate
 an
 acquisition
 agreement
 with
 him.

 
 
 
 "As
 I
 have
 indicated
 publicly
 in
 the
 past,
 I
 believe
operating
 management
 of
 the
 company
 has
 performed
 well
 and
 that
appropriate
 consideration
 should
 be
 given
 to
 a
 significant
equity
 interest
 for
 them
 in
 the
 company
 following
 the
acquisition,"
 Sosnoff
 said
 in
 the
 letter
 to
 Gluck.

 
 
 
 MTS
 said
 Sosnoff
 has
 asked
 the

 to
 fix
 March
 27

<TITLE>DUTCH
 PLANNING
 AGENCY
 FORECASTS
 LOWER
 GROWTH</TITLE>
<BODY>Dutch
 economic
 growth
 is
 slowing
 as
 a
firming
 guilder
 cuts
 competitiveness
 abroad
 and
 industries
reduce
 the
 pace
 of
 investment,
 the
 Dutch
 official
 planning
agency
 CPB
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 Centraal
 Planbureau,
 publishing
 its
 1987
 economic
outlook,
 said
 Dutch
 Net
 National
 Income
 (NNI)
 was
 expected
 to
grow
 by
 one
 pct
 this
 year,
 down
 from
 two
 pct
 growth
 recorded
 in
1986
 and
 2.5
 pct
 in
 1985
 and
 1984.

 
 
 
 Dutch
 Gross
 National
 Product
 is
 expected
 to
 rise
 to
 432.20
billion
 guilders
 in
 1987
 in
 constant
 prices,
 a
 two
 pct
 increase
from
 last
 year's
 423.95
 billion.

 
 
 
 The
 CPB,
 forecasting
 an
 8.5
 pct
 increase
 in
 the
 value
 of
the
 guilder
 on
 a
 trade-weighted
 basis
 compared
 with
 10.0
 pct
last
 year,
 said
 the
 dollar
 was
 expected
 to
 trade
 at
 an
 average
of
 2.0
 guilders
 in
 1987
 compared
 with
 2.45
 guilders
 in
 1986.

 
 
 
 "The
 higher
 guilder
 is
 causing
 a
 substantial
 fall
 in
 unit
labour
 costs
 abroad,
 when
 measured
 in
 guilder
 terms,
 while
these
 are
 rising
 slightly
 in
 the
 Netherlands,"
 the
 CPB
 said.

 
 
 
 More
 of
 economic
 growth
 now
 depended
 on
 domestic
consumption,
 the
 CPB
 said,
 but
 noting
 that
 higher
 margins
 set
by
 domestic
 producers
 and
 importers
 mitigated
 the
 effect
 on
purchasing
 power
 of
 lower
 import
 costs
 and
 deflation.

 
 
 
 Consumer
 prices
 were
 set
 to
 fall
 by
 1.5
 pct
 this
 year,
 the
CPB
 said.
 Inflation
 was
 zero
 last
 year.

 
 
 
 Gross
 investment
 in
 industry
 was
 expected
 to
 grow
 by
 five
pct
 this
 year,
 a
 slowdown
 compared
 with
 11.5
 pct
 growth
 last
year,
 the
 CPB
 said.

 
 
 
 Exchange
 rate
 and
 oil
 price
 fluctuations
 will
 continue
 to
condition
 the
 Dutch
 economy
 in
 the
 future
 as
 it
 has
 in
 recent
years,
 the
 CPB
 said,
 noting
 a
 continued
 depressing
 impact
 of
these
 factors
 on
 Dutch
 competitiveness.

 
 
 
 In
 addition,
 it
 noted
 a
 slight
 rise
 in
 taxation
 and
 social
security
 costs
 to
 employers.

 
 
 
 The
 CPB,
 forecasting
 a
 rise
 in
 the
 budget
 deficit
 to
 7.2
pct
 of
 Net
 National
 Income
 in
 1987
 from
 6.3
 pct
 last
 year,
urged
 the
 government
 to
 cut
 expenditure
 further
 to
 bring
 down
the
 deficit
 and
 reduce
 tax
 and
 social
 security
 payments
 in
future.

 
 
 
 Dutch
 government
 revenue
 is
 being
 depressed
 further
 by
falling
 income
 from
 natural
 gas
 sales
 in
 1987,
 the
 CPB
 said.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 unemployment
 was
 expected
 to
 fall
 to
 675,000
 this
year
 from
 710,000
 last
 year.

 
 
 
 While
 the
 two
 pct
 GDP
 growth
 forecast
 set
 by
 the
 CPB
 is
within
 its
 latest
 forecast,
 issued
 last
 month,
 of
 1.5
 to
 two
pct
 growth,
 the
 figure
 is
 well
 above
 recent
 market
 estimates.

 
 
 
 Dutch
 merchant
 bank
 Pierson,
 Heldring
 en
 Pierson
 said
 in
its
 February
 economic
 outlook
 that
 GDP
 growth
 at
 constant
prices
 was
 expected
 to
 be
 1.1
 pct
 this
 year
 and
 market
 analysts
had
 expected
 the
 CPB's
 final
 forecast
 to
 be
 below
 its
 own
latest
 estimate.

 
 
 
 "It
 is
 too
 early
 to
 comment
 because
 I
 haven't
 seen
 the
 whole
document
 yet,
 but
 it
 would
 seem
 we
 are
 more
 pessimistic
 in
 some
of
 our
 estimates,"
 a
 Pierson
 economist
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 CPB
 forecast
 2.5
 pct
 export
 growth
 in
 volume
 terms
 in
1987,
 after
 four
 pct
 growth
 last
 year.
 Excluding
 energy
exports,
 the
 1987
 figure
 would
 be
 two
 pct,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 Imports
 were
 set
 to
 rise
 by
 4.5
 pct
 this
 year
 compared
 with
four
 pct
 in
 1986
 in
 volume
 terms,
 the
 CPB
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 balance
 of
 payments
 would
 see
 a
 sharp
 decline
 in
 the
surplus,
 to
 six
 billion
 guilders
 in
 1987
 compared
 with
 12.1
billion
 last
 year,
 the
 CPB
 forecast.

 nearly

 The

 which
 seeks

 that
both

 the

 The

 said
 a

 will
 result
 in
 the
permanent

 In

<TITLE>TECHNOLOGY/NEW
 ERA
 FOR
 INFORMATION
 HANDLING</TITLE>
<BODY>Ground-breaking
 new
 systems
 for
 storing
and
 retrieving
 information
 are
 ushering
 in
 a
 new
 era
 for
computer
 companies
 and
 computer
 users.

 
 
 
 Within
 the
 past
 few
 weeks,
 International
 Business
 Machines
Corp
 &lt;IBM>,
 Eastman
 Kodak
 Co
 &lt;EK>
 and
 others
 have
 launched
products
 that
 radically
 increase
 the
 amount
 of
 data
 that
 can
 be
catalogued
 and
 shelved
 in
 computerized
 libraries.

 
 
 
 "This
 flurry
 of
 new
 technology
 could
 yield
 systems
 that
handle
 a
 multimedia
 blitz
 of
 data,"
 said
 Ian
 Warhaftig,
 a
senior
 analyst
 with
 International
 Data
 Corp,
 Framingham,
 Mass.

 
 
 
 "We're
 developing
 new
 systems
 because
 our
 customers
 are
asking
 for
 them,"
 Peter
 Giles,
 vice
 president
 and
 general
manager
 of
 Kodak's
 mass
 memory
 division,
 said
 in
 a
 recent
interview.

 
 
 
 This
 demand
 is
 expected
 to
 soar
 in
 coming
 years.
 While
estimates
 vary,
 industry
 analysts
 project
 that
 providing
products
 and
 services
 geared
 for
 information
 storage
 and
retrieval
 could
 become
 a
 20
 billion
 dlr
 a
 year
 business
 by
1995.

 
 
 
 A
 wide
 range
 of
 technologies
 will
 be
 needed
 to
 meet
 the
varying
 requirements
 of
 users.

 
 
 
 For
 example,
 a
 large
 credit
 verification
 service
 would
 want
a
 system
 from
 which
 it
 could
 quickly
 retrieve
 credit
 data
 and
relay
 it
 to
 its
 clients.
 A
 law
 firm,
 however,
 may
 need
 a
computerized
 law
 library
 in
 which
 capacity,
 rather
 than
 speed,
is
 the
 key
 feature.
 For
 architects
 and
 engineers,
 the
 ability
to
 store
 photographs,
 sketches
 and
 other
 graphics
 would
 be
crucial.

 
 
 
 Regardless
 of
 the
 specific
 application,
 the
 trend
 is
 toward
converting
 information
 -
 documents,
 video
 or
 film
 or
 even
 sound
recordings
 -
 into
 to
 the
 digital
 language
 of
 zeros
 and
 ones
understood
 by
 computers.

 
 
 
 Saving
 space
 is
 the
 key
 goal
 in
 digitizing
 data
 for
storage.
 An
 optical
 disk
 the
 size
 of
 a
 standard
 compact
 disk
can
 store
 550
 megabytes
 of
 data,
 or
 about
 250,000
 pages
 of
typewritten
 text.

 
 
 
 For
 this
 reason,
 the
 compact
 disk
 read-only
 memory,
 or
CD-ROM,
 is
 already
 a
 popular
 data
 storage
 media.
 Last
 week,
Microsoft
 introduced
 Microsoft
 Bookshelf,
 a
 300
 dlr
 program
that
 contains,
 on
 a
 single
 CD-ROM
 disk,
 a
 dictionary,
thesaurus,
 national
 ZIP
 code
 directory,
 Bartlett's
 Familiar
Quotations,
 the
 World
 Almanac
 and
 other
 reference
 works.

 
 
 
 Scores
 of
 such
 products
 are
 already
 on
 the
 market,
 but
 most
are
 specialty
 items,
 such
 as
 Lotus
 Development
 Corp's
 &lt;LOTS>
CD-ROM
 data
 base
 of
 stock
 information
 for
 financial
 analysts
and
 investors.
 "Microsoft
 Bookshelf
 is
 important
 because
 it
marks
 the
 arrival
 of
 CD-ROM
 packages
 for
 the
 general
 public,"
said
 Ian
 Warhaftig
 of
 International
 Data
 Corp.

 
 
 
 One
 drawback
 of
 the
 CD-ROM,
 which
 uses
 a
 laser
 to
 record
and
 read
 data,
 is
 that
 that
 it
 requires
 a
 special
 player.
CD-ROM
 players
 for
 the
 retail
 market
 will
 appear
 later
 this
year.

 
 
 
 Moreover,
 IDC's
 Warhaftig
 said
 CD-ROM's
 will
 be
 integrated
with
 personal
 computers.

 
 
 
 "Eventually,
 CD-ROM's
 will
 fit
 right
 inside
 the
 PC
 box,"
 he
said.
 "Imagine
 the
 advantage
 of
 having
 a
 spelling
 checker
 and
thesaurus
 at
 your
 fingertips
 when
 you're
 writing
 with
 a
 word
processing
 program."

 
 
 
 But
 CD-ROM's
 are
 just
 the
 beginning.
 Also
 last
 week,
 Kodak
unveiled
 several
 systems
 that
 use
 12-inch
 optical
 disks.
 The
largest
 Kodak
 system
 uses
 a
 jukebox-like
 cabinet
 to
 hold
 up
 to
150
 optical
 disks
 from
 which
 data
 can
 be
 retrieved
 in
 a
 matter
of
 seconds.

 
 
 
 Kodak
 also
 announced
 a
 14-inch
 optical
 disk
 with
 6.8
gigabytes
 of
 memory,
 five
 times
 the
 memory
 of
 a
 CD-ROM.
 The
Kodak
 disk,
 which
 will
 not
 be
 available
 until
 the
 middle

1988,
 is
 designed
 for
 users
 who
 need
 quick

 said
 Kodak's

 Meanwhile,
 N.V.
 Philips
 &lt;PGLO.AS>,
 the
 Dutch
 electronics
giant,
 is
 preparing
 to
 take
 optical
 disk
 technology
 a
 step
further
 with
 the
 first
 disk
 that
 can
 combine
 text,
 video
 and
sound.
 Philips
 said
 the
 system,
 called
 Called
 CD-Interactive,
will
 be
 ready
 next
 year.
 It
 will
 include
 a
 new
 kind
 of
 CD-ROM
player
 that
 can
 hook
 up
 with
 a
 television
 set
 and
 stereo.

 
 
 
 
 Additional
 breakthroughs
 are
 expected
 as
 the
 next
generation
 of
 computer
 memory
 chips
 are
 introduced.
 Last
 month
IBM
 said
 it
 has
 made
 a
 four-megabyte
 chip,
 capable
 of
 storing
more
 data
 than
 eight
 CD-ROM's.
 Meantime,
 &lt;Nippon
 Telegraph
 and
Telephone>
 of
 Japan
 said
 it
 has
 built
 a
 16-megabyte
 chip.

 
 
 
 Analysts
 say
 commercial
 versions
 of
 these
 chips
 are
 several
years
 away,
 though
 some
 suspect
 that
 IBM
 may
 start
 volume
production
 of
 its
 four-megabyte
 chip
 sometime

 Such

<BODY>Hundreds
 of
 marines
 were
 on

at
 11
 key
 Brazilian

 after
 40,000
 seamen
 decided
 to
 remain
on
 indefinite
 strike,
 even
 after
 the
 Higher
 Labour
 Court
Saturday
 ruled
 it
 illegal,
 union
 leaders
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 halt,
 the
 first
 national
 strike
 by
 seamen
 in
 25
 years,
started
 on
 February
 27,
 and
 union
 leaders
 said
 they
 would
 not
return
 to

 unless
 they
 got
 a

 rise.
 Shipowners
have
 offered
 a

 which
 the
 seamen
 rejected.

 
 
 
 "We
 have
 nothing
 to
 lose.
 If
 they
 want
 to
 lay
 off
 the
workers,
 fine,
 but
 we
 are
 determined
 to
 carry
 on
 with
 our

 a

 said.

 He
 said
 they
 had
 decided
 in
 a
 meeting
 that
 if
 the
 marines
take
 over
 the
 ships,
 the
 seamen
 would
 abandon
 the
 vessels
 and
let
 the
 marines
 handle
 the
 situation
 by
 themselves.

 
 
 
 A
 spokesman
 for
 the
 Rio
 de

 Port
 said
 the
 order
 to
send
 marines
 to
 take
 over
 the
 ports
 was
 given
 by
 Navy
 Minister
Henrique
 Saboya
 on
 grounds
 that
 ports
 are
 areas
 of
 national
security.
 But
 he
 said
 there
 were
 no
 incidents.
 The
 strike
 has
cut
 exports
 and
 imports
 and
 made
 an
 estimated
 160
 ships
 idle.

 
 
 
 Petrol
 station

 in
 four

 also
 continued
 their

 there
 were

 that

 PROFITS
 DOWN</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 American
 Bankers
 Association
 said
the
 profitability
 of
 the
 nation's
 commercial
 banks
 declined
 by
12
 pct
 during
 the
 first
 three
 quarters
 of
 1986.

 
 
 
 During
 the
 first
 nine
 months
 of
 last
 year,
 the
 industry's
annualized
 rate
 of
 return
 on
 assets
 dropped
 to
 0.68
 pct
 from
0.77
 pct
 in
 the
 same
 period
 in
 1985,
 the
 ABA
 said.
 Return
 on
equity
 fell
 to
 10.8
 pct
 from
 12.3
 pct
 the
 previous
 year.

 
 
 
 Despite
 the
 decline
 in
 profits,
 the
 ABA
 said
 banks'
 capital
grew
 boosting
 the
 industry's
 capital
 ratio
 to
 6.4
 pct
 from
 6.3
pct.

 
 
 
 The
 number
 and
 size
 of
 banks
 losing
 money
 during
 the
 period
increased
 significantly,
 the

 SEES
 STRONG
 PAPER
 MARKET
 IN
 '87</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 American
 Paper
 Institute
 said
 the
industry
 is
 headed
 for
 another
 year
 of
 record
 volume
 in
 1987,
with
 linerboard
 particularly
 strong.

 
 
 
 "A
 pro-growth
 trade
 policy,
 continued
 attention
 to
 currency
management,
 a
 fairly
 low
 interest
 rate
 climate
 and
 no
 major
 tax
increases
 are
 the
 essential
 ingredients
 in
 this
 outlook,"
 Red
Cavaney,
 American
 Paper
 Institute
 president
 said.

 
 
 
 Cavaney
 said
 that
 so
 far
 this
 year
 the
 industry's
performance
 mimics
 last
 year's
 strength.

 
 
 
 Last
 year,
 he
 said,
 paper
 and
 paperboard
 production
 hit
 a
record
 71
 mln
 tons,
 5.9
 pct
 above
 1985's
 67
 mln
 tons,
 while
industry
 after-tax
 profits
 in
 1986
 exceeded
 1985
 profits.

 
 
 
 Cavaney
 said
 that
 inventories
 will
 play
 a
 major
 role
 in
this
 year's
 performance.

 
 
 
 "Inventories,
 which
 are
 generally
 low,
 are
 a
 positive
factor
 in
 the
 industry's
 outlook
 this
 year,"
 he
 said,
 citing
market
 pulp
 stocks,
 which
 are
 currently
 at
 21
 days
 supply,
 at
the
 low
 end
 of
 the
 industry's
 long
 term
 average.

 
 
 
 Cavaney
 added
 that
 as
 a
 result
 of
 slimmer
 inventories
 in
1986
 and
 in
 the
 early
 part
 of
 this
 year,
 shipments
 for
 1987
 as
a
 whole
 will
 be
 higher
 than
 last
 year,
 even
 if
 demand
 slackens.

 
 
 
 Cavaney
 said,
 however,
 he
 expects
 demand
 this
 year
 to
 be
strong,
 spurred
 by
 consumer
 spending.

 
 
 
 The
 benefits
 of
 tax
 reform
 on
 individual
 after-tax
 income
and
 consumer
 goods
 companies'
 cash
 flow,
 he
 said,
 will
 increase
demand
 for
 both
 communications
 paper
 and
 packaging
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 In
 addition,
 Cavaney
 said
 low
 mortgage
 rates
 should
 support
high
 levels
 of
 housing
 starts
 in
 1987,
 increasing
 demand
 for
many
 kinds
 of
 packaged
 goods.

 
 
 
 Inventory
 building
 should
 help
 demand
 for
 cartons
 and
corrugated
 containers
 this
 year,
 he
 added.

 
 
 
 Cavaney
 said
 he
 expects
 exports
 to
 remain
 fairly
 high
 in
1987,
 as
 well,
 as
 a
 result
 of
 the
 recent
 declines
 in
 the
 dollar
against
 major
 world
 currencies.

 
 
 
 But
 more
 importantly,
 he
 said,
 an
 improved
 balance
 of
 trade
in
 1987
 from
 the
 lower
 dollar
 would
 induce
 increased
 industrial
activity
 at
 home
 and
 thus
 higher
 packaging
 demand.

 
 
 
 Cavaney
 said
 increased
 competitiveness,
 caused
 by
 lower
costs,
 higher
 productivity
 and
 improved
 efficiency
 would
 also
contribute
 to
 a
 strong
 showing
 from
 the
 industry
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 Cavaney
 said,
 however,
 that
 the
 Tax
 Reform
 Act
 of
 1986
could
 have
 a
 negative
 impact
 on
 the
 industry
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 "For
 manufacturers,
 the
 removal
 of
 the
 investment
 tax
credit
 creates
 an
 impediment
 to
 future
 investment,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 Also,
 he
 said
 API
 estimates
 the
 industry
 will
 lose
 three
billion
 dlrs
 in
 cash
 flow
 over
 a
 five
 year
 period
 as
 a
 result
of
 reforms.

 
 
 
 "Adjustments
 to
 this
 loss
 will
 require
 time
 and
 careful
evaluation
 and
 will
 adversely
 affect
 the
 capital
 spending
decisions
 of
 individual
 companies,"
 Cavaney
 said.

<BODY>West

 takes
 "very

 the
recent
 undertaking
 by
 major
 industrial
 countries
 to
 promote
exchange
 rate
 stability
 around
 current
 levels,
 Finance
 Ministry
State
 Secretary
 Hans
 Tietmeyer
 said.

 
 
 
 Talking
 to
 journalists
 before
 a
 meeting
 of
 European
Community
 Economy
 and
 Finance
 Ministers
 here,
 Tietmeyer
declined
 to
 say
 whether
 the
 February
 22
 Paris
 accord
 by
 the
Group
 of
 Five
 countries
 plus
 Canada
 included
 secret
 agreements
for
 stabilising
 currencies.

 
 
 
 But
 he
 noted
 the
 official
 communique
 said
 the
 participants
agreed
 to
 cooperate
 closely
 to
 foster
 stability
 of
 exchange
rates
 around
 current
 levels.
 "We're
 taking
 this
 sentence
 very
seriously,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 Tietmeyer
 remarked
 that
 the
 dollar
 had
 hardly
 moved
 against
the
 mark
 since
 the
 meeting.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 a
 slowdown
 in
 West
 German
 economic
 growth
 had
 been
caused
 by
 sharp
 exchange
 rate
 swings
 and
 that
 the
 Paris
agreement
 should
 help
 in
 this
 respect.

 
 
 
 Economics
 Ministry
 State
 Secretary
 Otto
 Schlecht
 said
 the
Bonn
 government
 saw
 no
 current
 need
 for
 measures
 to
 bolster
 the
economy
 but
 was
 paying
 close
 attention
 to
 the
 slower
 growth
 and
had
 not
 ruled
 out
 "appropriate
 and
 timely"
 action
 if
 necessary.

 
 
 
 Schlecht
 and
 Tietmeyer
 were
 speaking
 ahead
 of
 a
 discussion
by
 the
 EC
 ministers
 of
 the
 latest
 EC
 Commission
 report
 on
 the
economic
 situation
 in
 the
 12-nation
 bloc.

 
 
 
 The
 Commission
 has
 sharply
 revised
 down
 expected
 German
gross
 national
 product
 growth
 this
 year
 to
 two
 pct
 from
 3.2
 pct
predicted
 last
 autumn
 and
 says
 Bonn
 has
 the
 most
 room
 of
 any
 EC
country
 to
 stimulate
 economic
 activity.

 
 
 
 Schlecht
 said
 the
 upturn
 in
 West
 Germany's
 economy
 slowed
in
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 of
 last
 year
 and
 the
 first
 quarter
 of
1987.
 But
 he
 said
 there
 was
 no
 cumulative
 downwards
 trend
 in
view
 that
 would
 make
 quick
 remedial
 action
 necessary.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 a
 number
 of
 favourable
 indicators
 such
 as
 high
level
 of
 investment
 and
 a
 good
 climate
 for
 consumption
 meant
 a
recovery
 could
 be
 expected,
 while
 exports
 would
 pick
 up
slightly
 during
 the
 course
 of
 the
 year.

 the
 enzyme
 adenosine
deaminase.

 
 
 
 The
 disorder
 is
 known
 as
 severe
 combined
 immunodeficiency
disease,
 or
 "bubble
 boy
 disease"

 
 
 
 Bubble
 Boy
 Disease
 is
 a
 rare
 but
 severe
 disease
 that
hampers
 the
 development
 of
 the
 immune
 system.
 It
 has
 killed
most
 of
 its
 victims
 before
 adulthood.

 
 
 
 Children
 with
 the
 disease
 are
 consigned
 to
 live
 in
 a
sterile
 environment,
 such
 as
 a
 plastic
 bubble,
 to
 avoid
infection,
 the
 company
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 study
 of
 Enzon's
 drug,
 conducted
 at
 Duke
 University,
showed
 that
 two
 children
 suffering
 from
 the
 disease
 were
treated
 for
 11
 and
 seven
 months,
 respectively,
 and
 were
 free
 of
serious
 infection
 during
 that
 time,
 the
 company
 said.
 The
results
 were
 published
 in
 the
 New
 England
 Journal
 of
 Medicine.

 
 
 
 The
 disease
 is
 caused
 by
 a
 missing
 enzyme,
 called
 Adenosine
Deaminase,
 or
 ADA,
 that
 is
 crucial
 to
 the
 development
 of
 the
immune
 system.

 
 
 
 Enzon
 said
 it
 has
 developed
 a
 technology
 to
 coat
 the
 enzyme
with
 a
 substance
 called
 polyethylene
 glycol,
 or
 PEG,
 serving
 to
disguise
 the
 enzyme
 when
 it
 is
 reintroduced
 into
 the
 body,
preventing
 rejection.

 
 
 
 "Marked
 improvement
 in
 laboratory
 tests
 of
 immune
 function
occurred
 in
 each
 child,
 along
 with
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 number
 of
T-lymphocytes,
 the
 immune
 cells
 that
 were
 missing
 before
treatment
 with
 PEG-ADA
 had
 begun,"
 the
 study
 said.

 
 
 
 "The
 children
 are
 now
 more
 active
 and
 have
 begun
 to
 gain
weight
 and
 height.
 Before
 treatment
 their
 growth
 had
 been
 very
poor
 in
 comparison
 to
 normal
 children
 of
 the
 same
 age,"
 the
study,
 conducted
 by
 Doctors
 Michael
 Hershfield
 and
 Rebecca
Buckley,
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 PEG-ADA
 injections
 were
 given
 once
 a
 week.
 Victims
 of
the
 disease
 have
 traditionally
 been
 treated
 by
 bone
 marrow
transplants,
 but
 for
 most,
 donors
 are
 not
 available
 or
transplantation
 is
 unsuccessful,
 the
 company
 said.
 Other
diseases
 caused
 by
 a
 missing
 enzyme
 might
 also
 be
 treated
 by
introducing
 a
 PEG
 coated
 enzyme,
 the
 article
 noted.

 after

 that
 a

 "The

 The

<TITLE>KENYAN
 ECONOMY
 FACES
 PROBLEMS,
 PRESIDENT
 SAYS</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 Kenyan
 economy
 is
 heading
 for
difficult
 times
 after
 a
 boom
 last
 year,
 and
 the
 country
 must
tighten
 its
 belt
 to
 prevent
 the
 balance
 of
 payments
 swinging
too
 far
 into
 deficit,
 President
 Daniel
 Arap
 Moi
 said.

 
 
 
 In
 a
 speech
 at
 the
 state
 opening
 of
 parliament,
 Moi
 said
high
 coffee
 prices
 and
 cheap
 oil
 in
 1986
 led
 to
 economic
 growth
of
 five
 pct,
 compared
 with
 4.1
 pct
 in
 1985.

 
 
 
 The
 same
 factors
 produced
 a
 two
 billion
 shilling
 balance
 of
payments
 surplus
 and
 inflation
 fell
 to
 5.6
 pct
 from
 10.7
 pct
 in
1985,
 he
 added.

 
 
 
 "But
 both
 these
 factors
 are
 no
 longer
 in
 our
 favour
 ...
 As
 a
result,
 we
 cannot
 expect
 an
 increase
 in
 foreign
 exchange
reserves
 during
 the
 year,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 price
 of
 coffee,
 Kenya's
 main
 source
 of
 foreign
exchange,
 fell
 in
 London
 today
 to
 about
 94
 cents
 a
 pound
 from
 a
peak
 of
 2.14
 dlrs
 in
 January
 1986.

 
 
 
 Crude
 oil,
 which
 early
 last
 year
 slipped
 below
 10
 dlrs
 a
barrel,
 has
 since
 crept
 back
 to
 over
 18
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 Moi
 said
 the
 price
 changes,
 coupled
 with
 a
 general
 decline
in
 the
 flow
 of
 capital
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world,
 made
 it
 more
difficult
 to
 finance
 the
 government's
 budget
 deficit.

 
 
 
 Kenya
 was
 already
 spending
 over
 27
 pct
 of
 its
 budget
 on
servicing
 its
 debts
 and
 last
 year
 it
 was
 a
 net
 exporter
 of
capital
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 its
 history,
 he
 added.

 
 
 
 "This
 is
 a
 clear
 indication
 that
 we
 are
 entering
 a
 difficult
phase
 as
 regards
 our
 external
 debts,
 and
 it
 is
 imperative
 that
we
 raise
 the
 rate
 of
 domestic
 savings
 and
 rely
 less
 on
 foreign
sources
 to
 finance
 our
 development,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 "It
 will
 be
 necessary
 to
 maintain
 strict
 discipline
 on
expenditure
 ...
 And
 members
 of
 this
 house
 will
 have
 to
 take
 the
lead
 in
 encouraging
 wananchi
 (ordinary
 people)
 to
 be
 more
frugal
 in
 satisfying
 immediate
 needs,"
 the
 president
 added.

<BODY>OPEC
 may
 be
 forced
 to
 meet
 before
 a

 June
 session
 to
 readdress
 its
 production
 cutting
agreement
 if
 the
 organization
 wants
 to
 halt
 the
 current
 slide
in
 oil
 prices,
 oil
 industry
 analysts
 said.

 
 
 
 "The
 movement
 to
 higher
 oil
 prices
 was
 never
 to
 be
 as
 easy
as
 OPEC
 thought.
 They
 may
 need
 an
 emergency
 meeting
 to
 sort
 out
the
 problems,"
 said
 Daniel
 Yergin,
 director
 of
 Cambridge
 Energy
Research
 Associates,
 CERA.

 
 
 
 Analysts
 and
 oil
 industry
 sources
 said
 the
 problem
 OPEC
faces
 is
 excess
 oil
 supply
 in
 world
 oil
 markets.

 
 
 
 "OPEC's
 problem
 is
 not
 a
 price
 problem
 but
 a
 production
issue
 and
 must
 be
 addressed
 in
 that
 way,"
 said
 Paul
 Mlotok,
 oil
analyst
 with
 Salomon
 Brothers
 Inc.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 the
 market's
 earlier
 optimism
 about
 OPEC
 and
 its
ability
 to
 keep
 production
 under
 control
 have
 given
 way
 to
 a
pessimistic
 outlook
 that
 the
 organization
 must
 address
 soon
 if
it
 wishes
 to
 regain
 the
 initiative
 in
 oil
 prices.

 
 
 
 But
 some
 other
 analysts
 were
 uncertain
 that
 even
 an
emergency
 meeting
 would
 address
 the
 problem
 of
 OPEC
 production
above
 the
 15.8
 mln
 bpd
 quota
 set
 last
 December.

 
 
 
 "OPEC
 has
 to
 learn
 that
 in
 a
 buyers
 market
 you
 cannot
 have
deemed
 quotas,
 fixed
 prices
 and
 set
 differentials,"
 said
 the
regional
 manager
 for
 one
 of
 the
 major
 oil
 companies
 who
 spoke
on
 condition
 that
 he
 not
 be
 named.
 "The
 market
 is
 now
 trying
 to
teach
 them
 that
 lesson
 again,"
 he
 added.

 
 
 
 David
 T.
 Mizrahi,
 editor
 of
 Mideast
 reports,
 expects
 OPEC
to
 meet
 before
 June,
 although
 not
 immediately.
 However,
 he
 is
not
 optimistic
 that
 OPEC
 can
 address
 its
 principal
 problems.

 
 
 
 "They
 will
 not
 meet
 now
 as
 they
 try
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 the
winter
 demand
 to
 sell
 their
 oil,
 but
 in
 late
 March
 and
 April
when
 demand
 slackens,"
 Mizrahi
 said.

 
 
 
 But
 Mizrahi
 said
 that
 OPEC
 is
 unlikely
 to
 do
 anything
 more
than
 reiterate
 its
 agreement
 to
 keep
 output
 at
 15.8
 mln
 bpd."

 
 
 
 Analysts
 said
 that
 the
 next
 two
 months
 will
 be
 critical
 for
OPEC's
 ability
 to
 hold
 together
 prices
 and
 output.

 
 
 
 "OPEC
 must
 hold
 to
 its
 pact
 for
 the
 next
 six
 to
 eight
 weeks
since
 buyers
 will
 come
 back
 into
 the
 market
 then,"
 said
 Dillard
Spriggs
 of
 Petroleum
 Analysis
 Ltd
 in
 New
 York.

 
 
 
 But
 Bijan
 Moussavar-Rahmani
 of
 Harvard
 University's
 Energy
and
 Environment
 Policy
 Center
 said
 that
 the
 demand
 for
 OPEC
 oil
has
 been
 rising
 through
 the
 first
 quarter
 and
 this
 may
 have
prompted
 excesses
 in
 its
 production.

 
 
 
 "Demand
 for
 their
 (OPEC)
 oil
 is
 clearly
 above
 15.8
 mln
 bpd
and
 is
 probably
 closer
 to
 17
 mln
 bpd
 or
 higher
 now
 so
 what
 we
are
 seeing
 characterized
 as
 cheating
 is
 OPEC
 meeting
 this
demand
 through
 current
 production,"
 he
 told
 Reuters
 in
 a

 interview.

 eased
 2.2
 pct
 in

 March
 to
 the
 weakest
 levels
since

 with

 &lt;GM>
 down
9.3
 pct.

 
 
 
 Ford
 Motor
 Co
 &lt;F>
 and
 Chrysler
 Corp
 &lt;C>
 both
 had
 gains.

 
 
 
 The
 decline
 by
 GM
 continued
 its
 trend
 of
 weaker
 sales
 since
the
 beginning
 of
 the
 1987
 model
 year,
 which
 has
 forced
 the
world's
 biggest
 corporation
 to
 cut
 its
 car
 production
 several
times
 through
 temporary
 and
 permanent
 layoffs
 at
 various
plants.

 
 
 
 Relatively
 weaker
 sales
 by
 all
 of
 the
 Detroit
 Big
 Three
carmakers
 have
 compelled
 the
 companies
 to
 offer
 a
 string
 of
sales
 incentives
 including
 cash
 rebates
 and
 below-market
interest
 loans
 in
 an
 effort
 to
 reignite
 the
 market.

 
 
 
 Incentives
 apparently
 had
 some
 success,
 analysts
 said,
 as
the
 seasonally
 adjusted
 annualized
 sales
 rate
 improved
 to
 7.5
mln
 compared
 with
 about
 7.0
 mln
 in
 late
 February.
 The
 eight
domestic
 carmakers
 sold
 8.2
 mln
 units
 during
 1986.

 
 
 
 GM
 said
 its
 sales
 of
 domestic-built
 cars
 in
 the
 March
 1-10
period
 declined
 to
 97,487
 from
 104,952
 a

 while

 rose
 14.4
 pct
 to
 40,131
 from
 35,081.
 There
 were
 eight
selling
 days
 in
 each
 period.

 
 
 
 Despite
 the
 lower
 car
 sales,
 the
 giant
 automaker
 had
 a
bright
 spot
 as
 its
 Chevrolet
 division,
 which
 is
 launching
 a
national
 sales
 campaign
 this
 month
 for
 its
 new
 Corsica
 and
Beretta
 compact
 cars,
 was
 up
 almost
 21
 pct
 when
 only
domestic-built
 cars
 were
 counted.
 GM's
 Buick
 division
 was
 also
up,
 by
 11.4
 pct,
 while
 Cadillac
 was
 down
 7.8
 pct,
 Pontiac
 was
off
 10.8
 pct
 and
 Oldsmobile
 plunged
 41
 pct.

 
 
 
 GM
 also
 showed
 an
 improvement
 in
 its
 market
 share
 to
 53.6
pct
 from
 48.1
 pct
 in
 late
 February,
 which
 analysts
 said
 was
partly
 due
 to
 the
 increasing
 sales
 for
 the
 new
 Chevrolets.

 
 
 
 Meanwhile,
 Ford
 said
 its
 car
 sales
 rose
 5.9
 pct
 to
 50,407
compared
 with
 47,592

<TITLE>ECUADOR
 SEEKS
 HALT

 BANKS
 IN
 1987</TITLE>
<BODY>Ecuador,
 stricken
 by
 a
 severe
 earthquake,
is
 seeking
 through
 negotiations
 with
 private
 foreign
 banks
 to
postpone
 all
 payments
 due
 to
 them
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 year,
Finance
 Minister
 Domingo
 Cordovez
 said.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 in
 a
 statement,
 "The
 idea
 with
 the
 foreign
 banks
 is
to
 obtain
 from
 them
 the
 best
 terms
 to
 give
 the
 Ecuadorean
economy
 a
 complete
 relief
 in
 the
 period
 of
 deferral
 of
 payments
on
 the
 foreign
 debt
 during
 the
 present
 year."

 
 
 
 The
 statement
 referred
 only
 to
 payments
 due
 to
 private
foreign
 banks,
 a
 senior
 government
 finance
 official
 told
Reuters.

 
 
 
 These
 creditors
 hold
 two-thirds
 of
 Ecuador's
 foreign
 debt
which
 totals
 8.16
 billion
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 It
 did
 not
 refer
 to
 debts
 maturing
 to
 foreign
 governments
and
 multilateral
 lending
 agencies,
 accounting
 for
 the
 remainder
of
 Ecuador's
 foreign
 debt,
 the
 official
 said.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 Ecuador
 owed
 the
 private
 foreign
 banks
 between
 450
and
 500
 mln
 dlrs
 in
 interest
 payments
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 1987
 and
about
 66
 mln
 in
 principal
 payments
 maturing
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 Cordovez
 said
 Ecuador
 would
 seek
 new
 loans
 from
multilateral
 organisations.
 A
 World
 Bank
 mission
 was
 due
 here
soon
 to
 evaluate
 emergency
 loans,
 government
 officials
 said.

 
 
 
 Ecuador
 has
 also
 appealed
 for
 emergency
aid
 from
 about
 40
 foreign
 governments.

 
 
 
 Government
 officials
 have
 calculated
 losses
 to
 the
 1987
budget
 from
 last
 Thursday's
 earthquake
 at
 926
 mln
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 In
 1986,
 Ecuador's
 total
 service
 on
 the
 foreign
 debt
 was
about
 996
 mln
 dlrs
 to
 all
 creditors.

 
 
 
 The
 quake
 ruptured
 Ecuador's
 main
 oil
 pipeline,
 suspending
crude
 exports
 for
 five
 months
 until
 the
 line
 is
 repaired.
 Oil
accounts
 for
 up
 to
 two-thirds
 of
 its
 total
 exports
 and
 up
 to
 60
pct
 of
 total
 revenues.
 Before
 the
 tremor,
 Ecuador
 suspended
interest
 payments
 on
 January
 31
 to
 private
 foreign
 banks.

 
 
 
 Officials
 said
 they
 stopped
 interest
 payments
 due
 to
 a
cash-flow
 squeeze
 stemming
 from
 a
 slide
 in
 world
 oil
 prices,
which
 cut
 1986
 exports
 by
 about
 25
 pct
 to
 2.18
 billion
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 Ecuadorean
 finance
 officials
 have
 been
 in
 telephone
 contact
every
 day
 this
 week
 with
 some
 of
 the
 banks
 who
 sit
 on
 its
14-bank
 advisory
 committee,
 the
 senior
 government
 finance
official
 said.
 The
 committee
 represents
 the
 country's
 400
 or
 so
private
 foreign
 bank
 creditors.

 
 
 
 Cordovez
 also
 said
 in
 the
 statement,
 "The
 banks
 should
perceive
 that
 it
 is
 impossible
 at
 this
 moment
 to
 comply
 with
what
 was
 forseen."

 
 
 
 Cordovez
 added,
 Ecuador
 must
 make
 a
 new
 proposal
 in
 line
with
 the
 reality
 since
 the
 earthquake
 by
 seeking
 better
 options
of
 deferment
 and
 of
 softening
 the
 negotiation
 conditions."

 
 
 
 Interest
 payments
 fall
 due
 at
 least
 monthly
 to
 private
foreign
 banks.

 
 
 
 Ecuador's
 initial
 proposal
 earlier
 this
 year
 was
 to
 make
only
 one
 semi-annual
 or
 one
 annual
 interest
 payment
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 Under
 this
 proposal,
 it
 sought
 to
 defer
 interest
 payments
until
 June
 at
 the
 earliest,
 foreign
 bankers
 and
 government
officials
 here
 said.

 
 
 
 Ecuadorean
 officials
 held
 their
 last
 formal
 meeting
 with
the
 advisory
 committee
 in
 New
 York
 in
 January,
 but
 the
negotiations
 were
 suspended
 on
 January
 16
 due
 to
 the
 12-hour
kidnapping
 of

paratroopers.

 
 
 
 The
 Red

 says
 that

 and
 at

4,000

 due

 was
 disappointed
 by
 the
 stalemate
 in
 recent
 coffee
talks
 in
 London,
 the
 chairman
 of
 the
 state-run
 Coffee
 Marketing
Board,
 CMB,
 said.

 
 
 
 "This

 more

 in

 dropped
 by
 200
 pounds
 per
 tonne
 of
robusta
 coffee,"
 J.
 Makumbi
 said
 when
 he
 returned
 from
 London
 on
Friday.

 
 
 
 Producers
 and
 consumers
 failed
 to
 agree
 on
 a
 quota
 formula
to
 share
 the
 world's
 coffee
 production
 during
 International
Coffee
 Organisation,
 ICO,
 talks
 that
 ended
 last
 week.

 
 
 
 Makumbi
 blamed
 the
 failure
 to
 set
 quotas,
 which
 were
suspended
 in
 Feburary
 last
 year,
 on
 Indonesian
 demands
 that
 its
quota
 be
 increased
 dramatically.

 
 
 
 Uganda
 --
 which
 earns
 about
 400
 mln
 dlrs
 annually
 from
coffee
 exports,
 over
 95
 pct
 of
 its

 earnings
 --
had
 sought
 to
 raise
 its
 ICO
 quota
 to
 3.0
 mln
 from
 2.45
 mln
60-kilo
 bags,
 according
 to
 sources
 close
 to
 the
 CMB.

 
 
 
 The
 CMB
 has
 estimated
 that
 production
 will
 rise
 20
 to
 25
pct
 in
 the
 current
 1986/87
 October-September
 season
 to
 over
three
 mln
 bags.

 
 
 
 For
 several
 years
 Uganda
 had
 been
 unable
 to
 meet
 its
 ICO
export
 quota
 as
 rebel
 activity
 disrupted
 the
 coffee
 industry.

 
 
 
 The
 Ugandan
 government
 depends
 on
 coffee
 export
 duties
 for
about
 60
 pct
 of
 its
 sales
 tax
 revenue
 and
 the
 industry
 employs
over
 half

 Petroleum

 its

 has

 further
 increased
 to
 a
 total

 The
 company
 explained
 that

 by
 buying
 an
 additional
4,950,000

 over

 Originally,
 Occidental

 At

Occidental
 said,
 the

<TITLE>CONGRESS
 MAY
 CURB
 U.S.
 AID
 TO
 DEVELOPMENT
 BANKS</TITLE>
<BODY>Congressional
 ire
 is
 rising
 against
the
 multinational
 development
 banks
 which
 make
 loans
 to
 help
other
 countries
 produce
 goods
 in
 direct
 competition
 with
beleagured
 U.S.
 farmers
 and
 miners.

 
 
 
 With
 a
 record
 U.S.
 trade
 deficit
 of
 169
 billion
 dlrs
 last
year
 and
 a
 farm
 economy
 in
 the
 doldrums,
 Congress
 is
 pressing
to
 hold
 back
 U.S.
 funds
 for
 the
 World
 Bank
 and
 other
development
 banks
 if
 the
 money
 is
 used
 to
 subsidize
 production
or
 to
 produce
 goods
 already
 in
 oversupply
 around
 the
 world.

 
 
 
 
 "American
 tax
 dollars
 are
 being
 used
 to
 subsidize
 foreign
agriculture
 and
 mineral
 production
 that
 is
 often
 in
 direct
competition
 with
 our
 producers,"
 Senator
 Don
 Nickles,
 an
Oklahoma
 Republican,
 said
 in
 a
 letter
 to
 fellow
 senators
seeking
 support
 for
 his
 legislation
 to
 limit
 these
 loans.

 
 
 
 Nickles
 and
 Senator
 Steven
 Symms,
 a
 conservative
 Republican
from
 Idaho,
 have
 introduced
 legislation
 that
 would
 strictly
limit
 U.S.
 funding
 of
 multinational
 development
 banks
 if
 they
make
 any
 loans
 to
 help
 developing
 countries
 produce
 surplus
commodities
 or
 minerals.

 
 
 
 Current
 law
 requires
 that
 the
 United
 States
 vote
 against
such
 loans
 but
 carries
 no
 reprisals
 if
 they
 are
 ultimately
approved
 by
 the
 banks.

 
 
 
 Treasury
 Secretary
 James
 Baker's
 assurances
 that
 U.S.
policy
 is
 to
 oppose
 these
 loans
 did
 not
 satisfy
 concerns
 raised
at
 two
 Senate
 committee
 hearings
 last
 week.

 
 
 
 Baker
 told
 a
 Senate
 Appropriations
 subcommittee
 on
 Foreign
Operations,
 "As
 a
 policy
 matter,
 we
 oppose
 loans
 for
 production
of
 commodities
 in
 oversupply."

 
 
 
 The
 senators
 cited
 a
 350-mln-dlr
 World
 Bank
 loan
 made
 to
Argentina
 last
 year
 to
 help
 it
 increase
 its
 agricultural
exports
 by
 one
 billion
 dlrs
 a
 year
 by
 1989.

 
 
 
 Nickles,
 Symms
 and
 others
 also
 have
 cited
 other
 loans
 such
as
 a
 1985
 World
 Bank
 loan
 to
 Hungary
 to
 expand
 livestock
exports
 and
 500
 mln
 dlrs
 lent
 to
 Thailand
 from
 1981
 to
 1985
 at
low
 interest
 rates
 for
 agriculture.

 
 
 
 Last
 year
 the
 Republican-controlled
 Senate
 voted
 three
times
 over
 the
 objections
 of
 the
 administration
 to
 cut
 U.S.
funding
 of
 development
 banks
 by
 the
 amount
 of
 these
 loans.

 
 
 
 But
 even
 with
 a
 65
 to
 15
 vote
 in
 favour
 of
 the
 proposal,
the
 restrictions
 were
 weakened
 in
 the
 final
 version.
 Only
 a
provision
 directing
 U.S.
 officials
 to
 vote
 disapproval
 cleared
Congress.

 
 
 
 This
 year's
 version,
 called
 the
 Foreign
 Agricultural
Investment
 Reform
 (FAIR)
 Act
 would
 require
 the
 U.S.
 to
 vote
against
 loans
 designed
 to
 increase
 production
 of
 surplus
commodities
 and
 minerals.
 Also,
 the
 recipient
 countries
 would
have
 to
 prove
 that
 the
 production,
 marketing
 and
 export
 of
 the
commodities
 could
 be
 handled
 without
 government
 subsidy.

 
 
 
 If
 the
 loan
 is
 approved
 over
 U.S.
 objections,
 the
 United
States
 would
 not
 increase
 or
 replenish
 funds
 for
 that
institution
 until
 it
 agrees
 to
 stop
 making
 such
 loans.

 
 
 
 Objections
 to
 such
 loans
 have
 most
 often
 been
 raised
 by
conservative
 Republicans
 who
 have
 traditionally
 opposed
 U.S.
funding
 for
 these
 international
 development
 banks.

 
 
 
 But
 the
 loss
 of
 many
 jobs
 to
 foreign
 competition
 has
 raised
similar
 concerns
 among
 more
 moderate
 senators.

 
 
 
 The
 administration
 opposes
 any
 legislation
 that
 would
 tie
its
 hands
 in
 votes
 on
 the
 loans.
 It
 argues
 there
 might
 be
instances
 in
 which
 a
 country
 needed
 the
 money
 to
 continue
 its
moves
 toward
 U.S.
 policies
 in
 other
 areas.

 
 
 
 Baker
 said
 the
 United
 States
 would
 continue
 to
 use
 its
leverage
 in
 the
 banks
 to
 require
 foreign
 trade
 liberalization
measures,
 often
 in
 the
 form
 of
 elimination
 of
 subsidies.

 
 
 
 Two
 House
 Republicans,
 Representatives
 Larry
 Craig
 of
 Idaho
and
 Beau
 Bolter
 of
 Texas,
 have
 introduced
 the
 bill.
 But
 it
faces
 stiff
 opposition
 in
 the
 House
 Banking
 Committee
 which
 has
blocked
 its
 consideration
 by
 the
 House
 in
 the
 past.

 
 
 
 Symms
 intends
 to
 offer
 the
 bill
 as
 an
 amendment
 to
 any
related
 legislation
 this
 year,
 an
 aide
 said.

 from
 December
 to
 a
seasonally

 annual
 rate
 of
 716,000

 the
 Commerce
Department
 said.

 
 
 
 The

 revised
 downward
 December's
 sales
 to
 a
 12.1
pct
 rise
 to
 768,000
 units
 from
 the
 previously

 was
 the
 largest
 since
 last
October
 when
 sales
 fell
 9.3

 53,000,
 up
 from
 49,000
 in
 December
 but
 down
from
 59,000
 in

 to
 a

 1.6
 pct
below
 January,
 1986,
 when
 they
 were
 a

 surpassing
 the
previous
 record
 119,100
 price
 set
 in

--
 the

<TITLE>KODAK
 &lt;EK>
 HAS
 NEW
 DATA
 STORAGE,
 USAGE
 SYSTEMS</TITLE>
<BODY>Eastman
 Kodak
 Co
 said
 it
 is
 introducing
four
 information
 technology
 systems
 that
 will
 be
 led
 by
 today's
highest-capacity
 system
 for
 data
 storage
 and
 retrieval.

 
 
 
 The
 company
 said
 information
 management
 products
 will
 be
the
 focus
 of
 a
 multi-mln
 dlr
 business-to-business
communications
 campaign
 under
 the
 threme
 "The
 New
 Vision
 of
Kodak."

 
 
 
 Noting
 that
 it
 is
 well-known
 as
 a
 photographic
 company,
Kodak
 said
 its
 information
 technology
 sales
 exceeded
 four
billion
 dlrs
 in
 1986.
 "If
 the
 Kodak
 divisions
 generating
 those
sales
 were
 independent,
 that
 company
 would
 rank
 among
 the
 top
100
 of
 the
 Fortune
 500,"
 it
 pointed
 out.

 
 
 
 The
 objective
 of
 Kodak's
 "new
 vision"
 communications
campaign,
 it
 added,
 is
 to
 inform
 others
 of
 the
 company's
commitment
 to
 the
 business
 and
 industrial
 sector.

 
 
 
 Kodak
 said
 the
 campaign
 will
 focus
 in
 part
 on
 the
information
 management
 systems
 unveilded
 today
 --

 
 
 
 --
 The
 Kodak
 optical
 disk
 system
 6800
 which
 can
 store
 more
than
 a
 terabyte
 of
 information
 (a
 tillion
 bytes).

 
 
 
 -
 The
 Kodak
 KIMS
 system
 5000,
 a
 networked
 information
management
 system
 using
 optical
 disks
 or
 microfilm
 or
 both.

 
 
 
 --
 The
 Kodak
 KIMS
 system
 3000,
 an
 optical-disk-based
 system
that
 allows
 users
 to
 integrate
 optical
 disks
 into
 their
 current
information
 management
 systems.

 
 
 
 --
 The
 Kodak
 KIMS
 system
 4500,
 a
 microfilm-based,
computer-assisted
 system
 which
 can
 be
 a
 starter
 system.

 
 
 
 Kodak
 said
 the
 optical
 disy
 system
 6800
 is
 a
write-once/ready-many-times
 type
 its
 Mass
 Memory
 Division
 will
market
 on
 a
 limited
 basis
 later
 this
 year
 and
 in
 quantity
 in
1988.

 
 
 
 Each
 system
 6800
 automated
 disk
 library
 can
 accommodate
 up
to
 150,
 14-inch
 optical
 disks.
 Each
 disk
 provides
 6.8
 gigabytes
of
 randomly
 accessible
 on-line
 storage.
 Thus,
 Kodak
 pointed
out,
 150
 disks
 render
 the
 more-than-a-terabyte
 capacity.

 
 
 
 Kodak
 said
 it
 will
 begin
 deliveries
 of
 the
 KIMS
 system
 5000
in
 mid-1987.
 The
 open-ended
 and
 media-independent
 system
 
allows
 users
 to
 incorporate
 existing
 and
 emerging
 technologies,
including
 erasable
 optical
 disks,
 high-density
 magnetic
 media,
fiber
 optics
 and
 even
 artificial
 intelligence,
 is
 expected
 to
sell
 in
 the
 700,000
 dlr
 range.

 
 
 
 Initially
 this
 system
 will
 come
 in
 a
 12-inch
 optical
 disk
version
 which
 provides
 data
 storage
 and
 retrieval
 through
 a
disk
 library
 with
 a
 capacity
 of
 up
 to
 121
 disks,
 each
 storing
2.6
 gigabytes.

 
 
 
 Kodak
 said
 the
 KIMS
 system
 3000
 is
 the
 baseline
 member
 of
the
 family
 of
 KIMS
 systems.
 Using
 one
 or
 two
 12-inch
 manually
loaded
 optical
 disk
 drives,
 it
 will
 sell
 for
 about
 150,000
 dlrs
with
 deliveries
 beginning
 in
 mid-year.

 
 
 
 The
 company
 said
 the
 system
 3000
 is
 fulling
 compatibal
 with
the
 more
 powerful
 KIMS
 system
 5000.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 the
 KIMS
 system
 4500
 uses
 the
 same
 hardware
 and
software
 as
 the
 system
 5000.
 It
 will
 be
 available
 in
 mid-1987
and
 sell
 in
 the
 150,000
 dlr
 range.

 it

 filed
 with
 the
 Maine
 Public

 Commission
 (MPUC)
 for
a
 two-stage
 base
 rate
 reduction.

 
 
 
 Bangor
 Hydro
 said
 the
 first
 stage,
 which
 could
 take
 effect
on
 April
 1
 and
 would
 stay
 effective
 until
 the
 MPUC
 makes
 a
final
 decision
 on
 the
 filing,
 could
 cut
 revenues
 by
 6.149
 mln
dlrs,
 or
 9.7
 pct.

 
 
 
 The
 company
 said
 lower
 federal
 income
 taxes
 and
 lower
capital
 costs
 prompted
 the
 filing.

 
 
 
 The
 second
 stage,
 Bangor
 Hydro
 said,
 effective
 when
 the

 makes
 a
 final
 decision,
 calls
 for
 an
 additional
 revenue
reduction
 of
 712,000

 or
 1.1
 pct.

 
 
 
 Bangor
 Hydro
 said,
 if

 the

 with
 7.5

 company
 also
 said
 it
 is
 seeking
 to
 increase
 its
fuel
 cost
 adjustment
 rate
 by
 April
 1.

 
 
 
 Bangor
 said
 if
 the
 increase
 is
 approved
 it
 could
 offset
much

 cut
 and
 may
 cause
 a

<TITLE>FOREIGN

 JUMPS
 IN
 LAST
 QTR</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 net
 inflow
 of
 foreign
 investment
into
 Australia
 jumped
 to
 7.3
 billion
 dlrs
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter
of
 1986
 from
 4.32
 billion
 in
 the
 third
 quarter
 and
 4.55
 billion
a
 year
 earlier,
 the
 Statistics
 Bureau
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 Bureau
 attributed
 the
 increase
 to
 a
 turnaround
 of
 2.08
billion
 dlrs
 in
 official
 sector
 transactions
 and
 a
 1.09
 billion
turnaround
 in
 direct
 investment.

 
 
 
 The
 turnaround
 in
 official
 transactions
 to
 a
 1.52
 billion
inflow
 from
 a
 555
 mln
 outflow
 in
 the
 third
 quarter,
 against
 a
520
 mln
 inflow
 a
 year
 earlier,
 was
 largely
 on
 account
 of
government
 foreign
 currency
 borrowings,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 Direct
 investment
 recorded
 a
 turnaround
 to
 a
 1.04
 billion
dlr
 inflow
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 from
 a
 57
 mln
 withdrawal
 in
the
 third
 quarter,
 against
 a
 546
 mln
 inflow
 in
 the
 fourth
quarter
 of
 1985,
 the
 Bureau
 said.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 the
 major
 part
 of
 the
 turnaround
 reflected
 an
injection
 of
 funds,
 estimated
 at
 around
 700
 mln
 dlrs,
associated
 with
 the
 previously
 reported
 restructuring
 of
 the
Australian
 operations
 of
 General
 Motors
 Corp
 &lt;GM>.

 
 
 
 GM
 used
 the
 funds
 to
 pay
 out
 or
 take
 over
 certain
Australian
 liabilities
 of
 its
 local
 unit
 &lt;General
Motors-Holden's
 Ltd>,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 However,
 net
 borrowings
 remained
 the
 major
 part
 of
 total
inflow,
 accounting
 for
 6.16
 billion
 dlrs
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter
against
 3.88
 billion
 in
 the
 third
 quarter
 and
 4.03
 billion
 a
year
 earlier,
 the
 Bureau
 said.

 
 
 
 Net
 official
 borrowings
 comprised
 1.52
 billion
 dlrs
 against
a
 net
 outflow
 of
 548
 mln
 in
 the
 third

 and
 a
 516
 mln
inflow
 a

 Total
 private

 4.64

 on
 some

farm
 and
 industrial
 products
 last
 month,
 a
 Council

 told

 He
 said
 the
 new

 was
 intended
 to
 balance

 its

 The

reached

<BODY>International
 efforts
 to
 redirect
 Japan's
export-driven
 economy
 toward
 domestic
 consumption
 face
 heavy
going
 if
 the
 country's
 largest
 defence
 contractor
 and
 world's
biggest
 shipbuilder
 is
 anything
 to
 go
 by.

 
 
 
 Mitsubishi
 Heavy
 Industries
 Ltd
 &lt;MITH.T>
 (MHI),
 which
 began
making
 ships
 and
 iron
 goods
 for
 Japan's
 military
 rulers
 130
years
 ago,
 is
 responding
 to
 the
 strong
 yen
 by
 redoubling
 its
efforts
 to
 maintain
 its
 share
 of
 export
 markets.

 
 
 
 "If
 we
 sell
 the
 best
 quality
 and
 the
 cheapest
 products,
everyone
 will
 buy
 them,"
 MHI
 president
 Yotaro
 Iida
 said.

 
 
 
 Although
 two
 of
 MHI's
 main
 businesses,
 shipbuilding
 and
power
 plant
 construction,
 have
 been
 hit
 hard
 by
 the
 yen's
 40
pct
 rise
 against
 the
 dollar,
 the
 company
 has
 no
 plans
 to
abandon
 them,
 Iida
 told
 Reuters
 in
 an
 interview.

 
 
 
 Its
 other
 big
 activity,
 aircraft
 component
 manufacture,
 has
performed
 so
 well
 that
 MHI
 now
 accounts
 for
 half
 of
 the
 money
Tokyo
 spends
 on
 defence
 procurement
 each
 year.

 
 
 
 "We
 have
 made
 the
 utmost
 efforts
 among
 the
 world's
manufacturers
 to
 improve
 productivity,"
 he
 said.
 "You
 may
 be
surprised
 if
 you
 come
 to
 see
 our
 plants.
 The
 outside
 is
 old
 but
the
 inside
 is
 ultra-modern,
 with
 robots
 and
 computers."

 
 
 
 Securities
 analysts
 at
 major
 securities
 houses
 agreed
 that
MHI
 has
 pared
 costs
 more
 quickly
 than
 its
 competitors.
 The
company
 has
 slashed
 its
 workforce
 to
 47,000
 from
 86,000
 in
1976.

 
 
 
 Despite
 its
 cost-cutting,
 MHI
 expects
 profits
 to
 drop
 40
pct
 to
 30
 billion
 yen
 in
 the
 current
 fiscal
 year
 ending
 March
31,
 from
 1985/86's
 record
 50.14
 billion.

 
 
 
 And
 that
 includes
 gains
 from
 the
 sale
 of
 MHI's
 stake
 in
Mitsubishi
 Motors
 Corp
 &lt;MIMT.T>
 for
 49
 billion
 yen.

 
 
 
 Iida
 is
 optimistic
 about
 the
 future,
 however.
 He
 said
 a
resurgence
 of
 demand
 from
 the
 Middle
 East
 following
 the
 recent
recovery
 in
 oil
 prices
 coupled
 with
 persistent
 demand
 for
 power
plants
 in
 developing
 countries
 will
 help
 MHI
 restore
 its
exports-to-sales
 ratio
 to
 the
 past
 decade's
 average
 of
 30
 pct.

 
 
 
 MHI's
 exports-to-sales
 ratio
 fell
 to
 25.9
 pct
 in
 the
half-year
 ended
 last
 September,
 from
 35
 to
 36
 pct
 five
 years
ago.

 
 
 
 China
 is
 the
 most
 promising
 market,
 although
 MHI
 also
considers
 other
 non-oil-producing
 developing
 countries
 as
 major
customers.

 
 
 
 "Our
 customers
 are
 all
 seen
 as
 being
 in
 trouble
 due
 to
 a
lack
 of
 foreign
 currency,"
 Iida
 said.
 But
 he
 added
 that
 he
 felt
MHI
 could
 sell
 to
 those
 markets
 with
 Japanese
 government
financial
 support.

 
 
 
 It
 can
 also
 finance
 the
 plants
 itself
 and
 recover
 its
investment
 through
 product
 sales,
 a
 strategy
 Iida
 said
 could
prove
 popular
 in
 the
 future.

 
 
 
 In
 shipping,
 MHI
 is
 fighting
 back
 against
 low-priced
 South
Korean
 competition
 by
 building
 more
 technologically
 advanced
carriers
 to
 carry
 liquefied
 natural
 gas
 and
 other
 products
difficult
 to
 transport.

 
 
 
 Shipbuilders
 Association
 officials
 told
 Reuters
 MHI
 is
 the
world's
 largest
 shipbuilder
 in
 terms
 of
 orders
 and
 capacity.

 
 
 
 Domestically,
 MHI
 is
 involved
 in
 12
 national
 projects,
including
 development
 of
 nuclear
 fusion
 reactors
 and
 launch
vehicles
 for
 man-made
 satellites.

 
 
 
 It
 has
 been
 the
 biggest
 contractor
 for
 the
 Japan
 Defence
Agency's
 F-15
 and
 F-14
 jet
 fighters
 and
 missiles,
 although
 all
of
 these
 have
 been
 built
 under
 licence
 from
 U.S.
 Firms.

 
 
 
 MHI
 is
 now
 heading
 up
 five
 Japanese
 companies
 seeking
 to
develop
 the
 country's
 own
 fighter
 plane
 to
 replace
 the
currently
 used
 F-1
 support
 fighters
 in
 the
 late
 1990s.

 
 
 
 Military
 experts
 said
 Washington
 is
 putting
 strong
 pressure
on
 Tokyo
 to
 buy
 a
 U.S.
 Plane,
 either
 the
 McDonnell
 Douglas
 Corp
F-18
 or
 General
 Dynamics
 Corp
 F-16,
 to
 reduce
 Japan's
 huge
trade
 surplus
 with
 the
 U.S.

 
 
 
 "It
 might
 be
 a
 good
 idea
 to
 jointly
 produce

<TITLE>JAPANESE
 BANKRUPTCIES
 DECLINE
 IN
 FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<BODY>Japan's
 corporate
 bankruptcies
 in
February
 fell
 10.8
 pct
 from
 January
 to
 1,071
 cases
 and
 total
debts
 dropped
 49.4
 pct
 to
 149.40
 billion
 yen,
 the
 Tokyo
Commerce
 and
 Industry
 Research
 Co
 said.

 
 
 
 February
 bankruptcies
 fell
 14.9
 pct
 from
 a
 year
 earlier,
the
 26th
 straight
 monthly
 decline,
 and
 debts
 fell
 54.3
 pct.

 
 
 
 The
 lower
 number
 of
 bankruptcies
 in
 February
 reflected
 a
relaxation
 of
 money
 market
 conditions
 and
 reduced
 bill
settlements
 due
 to
 fewer
 operating
 days,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 Bankruptcies
 caused
 by
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 yen
 against
 the
dollar
 totalled
 69,
 or
 6.4
 pct
 of
 those
 in
 February,
 with
 debts
of
 25.52
 billion
 yen,
 the
 research
 firm
 said.

 
 
 
 This
 compared
 with
 64
 with
 debts
 of
 125.59
 billion
 yen
 in
January,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 Currency-linked
 bankruptcies
 since
 November
 1985,
 when
 the
dollar's
 depreciation
 against
 the
 yen
 began
 to
 affect
 Japanese
export-linked
 firms,
 totalled
 772,
 with
 cumulative
 debts
 of
660.53
 billion
 yen,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 value
 of
 the
 yen
 against
 the
 dollar
 rose
 to
 an
 average
153.49
 yen
 per
 dollar
 in
 February
 from
 184.62
 a
 year
 earlier.

 
 
 
 Bankruptcies
 usually
 decline
 in
 the
 first
 quarter
 of
 the
year
 due
 to
 fewer
 operating
 days
 and
 for
 seasonal
 reasons.

 
 
 
 Bankruptcies
 are
 expected
 to
 increase
 in
 the
 quarter
starting
 April
 1
 due
 to
 expectations
 of
 slow
 consumer
 spending,
low
 wage
 increases
 for
 the
 1987/88
 fiscal
 year
 which
 starts
 in
April,
 and
 slow
 capital
 spending
 by
 manufacturers,
 the
 company
said.

 
 
 
 Bankrupcties
 among
 export-linked
 subcontractors
 will
 rise
due
 to
 a
 recent
 shift
 by
 major
 manufacturers
 to
 overseas
production,
 it
 added.

<TITLE>LEIGH-PEMBERTON
 OPPOSES
 TAKEOVER
 PROTECTION
 RULES</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 Bank
 of
 England
 does
 not
 favour
 the
introduction
 of
 rules
 to
 shield
 companies
 from
 hostile
 takeover
attempts,
 its
 governor,
 Robin
 Leigh-Pemberton,
 said.

 
 
 
 Instead,
 merchant
 banks
 advising
 bidding
 companies
 must
show
 restraint
 and
 responsibility
 to
 avoid
 the
 excesses
 that
have
 marred
 recent
 takeovers,
 he
 told
 the
 Yorkshire
 and
Humberside
 Regional
 Confederation
 of
 British
 Industries'
 annual
dinner.

 
 
 
 Leigh-Pemberton
 also
 called
 on
 companies
 to
 improve
 ties
with
 institutional
 investors,
 suggesting
 representatives
 of
those
 institutions
 be
 granted
 seats
 on
 the
 boards
 of
 directors
of
 companies
 they
 invest
 in.

 
 
 
 "Boards
 cannot
 expect
 protection
 from
 unwelcome
 predators,
for
 that
 is
 but
 a
 short
 step
 from
 saying
 that
 they
 should
 be
protected
 from
 their
 own
 shareholders
 --
 who
 are,
 after
 all,
the
 proprietors
 of
 the
 company,"
 Leigh-Pemberton
 said.

 
 
 
 He
 added
 takeovers
 and
 mergers
 had
 an
 important
 role
 to
play
 in
 furthering
 economies
 of
 scale,
 integration
 and
 more
efficient
 market
 penetration.
 "The
 degree
 of
 success
 or
 failure
(of
 a
 takeover)
 has
 not
 in
 my
 experience
 depended
 on
 whether
 or
not
 the
 takeover
 was
 contested,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 Leigh-Pemberton
 noted
 there
 had
 been
 excesses
 in
 takeover
activity
 in
 the
 recent
 past.
 "The
 aim
 is
 to
 pressurise
 a
company's
 management
 into
 action
 dedicated
 solely
 to
 a
favourable
 impact
 on
 the
 share
 price
 in
 the
 short-term,
 partly
or
 even
 primarily
 at
 the
 expense
 of
 the
 future,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 Such
 bids
 "often
 depend
 for
 their
 success
 on
 creating
 a
highly-charged
 and
 artificial
 situation
 in
 the
 share
 market,
and
 give
 rise
 to
 temptations,
 on
 both
 sides
 of
 the
 battle,
 to
engage
 in
 aggressive,
 even
 manipulative
 tactics
 that
 are
immensely
 damaging
 to
 the
 interest
 of
 the
 shareholders,"
 he
said.

 
 
 
 In
 a
 clear
 reference
 recent
 events,
 he
 said
 "those
 in
 the
City
 who
 act
 for
 companies
 or
 individuals
 ..
 Must,
 I
 suggest,
be
 ready
 to
 accept
 a
 full
 measure
 of
 responsibility
 --
 even
 if
it
 entails
 opprobrium
 --
 for
 the
 transactions
 that
 may
 result."

 
 
 
 They
 "should
 exercise
 the
 most
 careful
 judgment
 at
 the
outset
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 clients
 for
 whom
 they
 act
 and
 the

 contenplated.
 Those
 who

 to

<TITLE>ECUADOR
 TO
 EXPORT
 NO
 OIL
 FOR
 4
 MONTHS,
 OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 suspension
 of
 Ecuador's
 crude
 oil
shipments
 after
 an
 earthquake
 cut
 an
 oil
 pipeline
 will
 last
 at
least
 four
 months,
 a
 senior
 Energy
 Ministry
 official
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 official
 said
 Ecuador
 could
 resume
 exports
 after
repairing
 a
 40
 km
 section
 of
 the
 510
 km
 pipeline,
 which
 links
jungle
 oil
 fields
 at
 Lago
 Agrio
 to
 Balao
 on
 the
 Pacific
 coast.
It
 would
 take
 about
 100
 mln
 U.S.
 Dlrs
 to
 repair
 the
 pipeline,
the
 official,
 who
 did
 not
 want
 to
 be
 named,
 told
 Reuters.
Ecuador
 had
 enough
 oil
 to
 meet
 domestic
 demand
 for
 about
 35
days
 and
 would
 have
 to
 import
 crude
 to
 supplement
 stocks.

 
 
 
 The
 earthquake
 last
 Thursday
 night
 registered
 six
 on
 the
12-point
 international
 Mercalli
 scale.
 The
 damage
 to
 the
pipeline
 was
 a
 severe
 economic
 blow
 to
 Ecuador,
 where
 oil
accounts
 for
 up
 to
 two-thirds
 of
 total
 exports
 and
 as
 much
 as
60
 pct
 of
 government
 revenues.

 
 
 
 Financially
 pressed
 Ecuador,
 a
 member
 of
 the
 Organisation
of
 Petroleum
 Exporting
 Countries
 (OPEC),
 was
 recently
 pumping
about
 260,000
 barrels
 per
 day
 (bpd)
 of
 crude,
 about
 50,000
 bpd
above
 the
 output
 quota
 assigned
 by
 the
 cartel,
 another
 Energy
Ministry
 spokesman
 said.
 Last
 year,
 it
 exported
 an
 average
 of
173,500
 bpd,
 according
 to
 the
 central
 bank.

 
 
 
 However,
 Ecuador
 might
 build
 an
 emergency
 25
 km
 pipeline,
costing
 15
 to
 20
 mln
 dlrs,
 to
 hook
 up
 with
 a
 Colombian
pipeline,
 the
 first
 official
 said.
 He
 estimated
 it
 could
 take
about
 60
 days
 to
 build.

 
 
 
 Ecuador,
 squeezed
 by
 the
 slide
 in
 world
 oil
 prices
 in
 1986,
had
 only
 138
 mln
 dlrs
 in
 net
 international
 reserves
 at
 the
 end
of
 January,
 about
 equal
 to
 one
 month's
 imports.

 
 
 
 It
 suspended
 interest
 payments
 in
 January
 on
 5.4
 billion
dlrs
 owed
 to
 about
 400
 private
 foreign
 banks.
 The
 country's
total
 foreign
 debt
 is
 8.16
 billion
 dlrs,
 the
 eighth
 largest
 in
Latin
 America.

 
 
 
 In
 Caracas,
 President
 Jaime
 Lusinchi
 said
 Venezuela
 would
loan
 five
 mln
 barrels
 of
 crude
 to
 Ecuador
 over
 the
 next
 three
months
 to
 make
 up
 for
 losses
 from
 damage
 to
 the
 pipeline.

 
 
 
 Ecuador
 asked
 for
 the
 loan
 to
 guarantee
 domestic
 supplies
and
 would
 ship
 an
 equivalent
 volume
 back
 to
 Venezuela
 in
repayment
 in
 May,
 Lusinchi
 said.

 Mannesmann

 told

 weekly

 that
Mannesmann
 wanted
 to
 invest
 in
 a

 Company
 in
 order
 to
strengthen

 Dieter
 said
 Mannesmann

 The

 said
 Mannesmann
 had
 a
 letter
 of
intent

 the

 from
 the
 heirs
 of
 the

 but

<BODY>Royal
 Dutch/Shell
 Group
 &lt;RD.AS>
 earnings
for
 1986
 from
 the
 U.S.
 Fell
 sharply
 because
 of
 difficult
 market
conditions,
 lower
 crude
 and
 gas
 prices
 and
 also
 due
 to
different
 accounting
 methods,
 Shell
 chairman
 Peter
 Holmes
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 Shell
 Oil
 dollar
 net
 income
 fell
 47
 pct
 in
 the
 year,
while
 the
 additional
 effect
 of
 currency
 movements
 reduced
 the
contribution
 to
 group
 net
 income
 by
 57
 pct
 to
 472
 mln
 stg.

 
 
 
 The
 group
 earlier
 reported
 a
 drop
 in
 net
 income
 for
 the
year
 to
 2.54
 billion
 stg
 from
 3.03
 billion
 previously,
 with
lower
 crude
 prices
 outweighing
 the
 effect
 of
 increased
 sales
 by
volume.

 
 
 
 Although
 the
 figures
 were
 lower,
 they
 were
 nonetheless
 at
the
 top
 end
 of
 market
 forecasts.
 Shell
 Transport
 and
 Trading
Plc
 &lt;SC.L>
 shares,
 the
 U.K.
 Arm
 of
 the
 group,
 rose
 to
 11.39
 stg
from
 a
 close
 last
 night
 of
 11.06
 stg.
 Analysts
 noted
 that
 a
general
 collapse
 in
 exploration
 and
 production
 volumes
 was
partially
 offset
 by
 earnings
 from
 chemicals
 rising
 to
 462
 mln
stg
 from
 205
 mln
 in
 1985.

 
 
 
 Also,
 a
 windfall
 tax
 credit
 and
 lower
 than
 expected
currency
 losses
 had
 added
 about
 100
 mln
 stg
 onto
 fourth
 quarter
results,
 which
 was
 the
 main
 reason
 for
 the
 figures
 exceeding
forecasts,
 industry
 analyst
 Chris
 Rowland
 of
 Barclays
 de
 Zoete
Wedd
 noted.

 
 
 
 However,
 he
 added
 there
 could
 well
 be
 a
 sharp
 fall
 in
performance
 in
 the
 first
 quarter
 of
 1987,
 due
 to
 the
improbability
 that
 the
 group
 would
 be
 able
 to
 repeat
 the
 high
refining
 and
 marketing
 margins
 of
 first
 quarter
 1986.

 
 
 
 The
 impact
 of
 recovering
 oil
 prices
 would
 come
 through
faster
 on
 the
 downstream
 side
 than
 on
 the
 upstream
 as
 such
 a
high
 proportion
 of
 upstream
 activity
 centred
 on
 gas,
 which
typically
 reacted
 to
 oil
 price
 changes
 with
 about
 a
 half-year
lag,
 analysts
 said.

 
 
 
 Holmes
 said
 that
 in
 the
 upstream
 U.S.
 Sector
 the
 third
quarter
 of
 1986
 had
 been
 the
 worst
 of
 all.

 
 
 
 Only
 two
 of
 the
 oil
 majors
 had
 managed
 to
 make
 a
 profit
 in
the
 period,
 with
 Shell
 Oil
 being
 one
 of
 them.
 The
 decrease
 in
U.S.
 Earnings
 had
 been
 accentuated
 by
 tax
 rates
 but
 the
 group
had
 increased
 share
 to
 become
 volume
 market
 leader,
 Holmes
added.

 
 
 
 Continued
 low
 crude
 oil
 prices
 would
 continue
 to
 subdue
U.S.
 Exploration
 activity.
 "Exploration
 is
 currently
 pretty
flat.
 We
 are
 going
 to
 go
 on,
 but
 at
 16-18
 dlrs
 there
 will
 be
 no
massive
 upturn,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 A
 renewal
 of
 exploration
 in
 high
 cost
 areas
 of
 the
 North
Sea
 and
 the
 U.S.
 Requires
 prices
 of
 around
 25
 dlrs
 a
 barrel.

 
 
 
 Ultimately
 this
 would
 lead
 to
 a
 rise
 in
 U.S.
 Imports.
 "If
you
 are
 not
 exploring
 you
 are
 not
 going
 to
 find
 anything,"
 he
noted.

 
 
 
 U.S.
 Oil
 production
 had
 dropped
 some
 half
 mln
 barrels
 a
 day
(bbd)
 in
 1986
 and
 would
 continue
 to
 fall
 if
 the
 price
 stayed
below
 20
 dlrs
 a
 barrel.

 
 
 
 This
 favored
 OPEC's
 attempts
 to
 stabilise
 prices,
 as
 the
lower
 the
 price
 the
 more
 likelihood
 there
 was
 of
 non-OPEC
marginal
 production
 shutting
 down.
 "OPEC
 has
 done
 pretty
extraordinarily
 well...Everything
 is
 moving
 in
 (its)
 direction,"
he
 added.

 go
 up
 to
 six

crowns
 from

 it

 A

 was
 mainly

 a
 five

 during

 which
 the

 blamed

 Last

 was

<BODY>Senate
 Banking
 Committee
 Chairman
William
 Proxmire
 said
 modified
 legislation
 to
 help
 a
 federal
deposit
 insurance
 fund
 and
 prohibit
 new
 limited-service
 banks
and
 thrifts
 could
 be
 ready
 for
 a
 Senate
 vote
 in
 two
 to
 three
weeks.

 
 
 
 Proxmire
 said
 he
 agreed
 to
 demands
 from
 committee
 members
for
 a
 one-year
 moratorium
 on
 granting
 new
 business
 powers
sought
 by
 commercial
 banks
 to
 increase
 the
 bill's
 chances.

 
 
 
 In
 its
 new
 form,
 the
 bill
 would
 proscribe
 regulators
 from
granting
 new
 powers
 to
 banks,
 Proxmire
 told
 reporters
 after
 a
speech
 to
 the
 U.S.
 League
 of
 Savings
 Institutions.

 
 
 
 A
 vote
 on
 the
 bill
 by
 the
 committee
 is
 scheduled
 for
Thursday.
 If
 approved
 it
 will
 go
 to
 the
 full
 Senate.

 
 
 
 "I
 have
 spoken
 to
 the

 leader
 and
 he
 has
 agreed
 to
bring
 it
 up
 promptly
 on
 the
 Senate
 floor
 in
 two
 or
 three
 weeks,"
Proxmire
 told
 the
 thrift
 executives.

 
 
 
 The
 bill
 would
 recapitalize
 the
 Federal
 Savings
 and
 Loan
Insurance
 Corp
 fund
 with
 7.5
 billion
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 It
 also
 would
 prohibit
 establishment
 of
 new
 nonbank
 banks
and
 nonthrift
 thrifts,
 so-called
 because
 they
 provide
 financial
services
 but
 do
 not
 meet
 the
 regulatory
 definition
 of
 both
making
 loans
 and
 receiving
 deposits.

<TITLE>TRADE
 BILL
 TO
 CHANGE
 AGRICULTURE
 TRADE
 LAWS</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 House
 Ways
 and
 Means
 Committee
is
 moving
 toward
 passage
 of
 a
 trade
 bill
 that
 sponsors
 said
 was
intended
 to
 help
 open
 foreign
 markets
 to
 U.S.
 agricultural
goods
 and
 to
 modify
 some
 U.S.
 agricultural
 trade
 laws.

 
 
 
 The
 trade
 subcommittee
 voted
 to
 require
 President
 Reagan
 to
take
 into
 account
 the
 potential
 harm
 to
 U.S.
 agricultural
exports
 of
 any
 trade
 retaliation
 he
 might
 impose
 for
 foreign
unfair
 trade
 practices
 against
 other
 domestic
 industries.

 
 
 
 The
 bill
 would
 allow
 U.S.
 agricultural
 producers
 to
 seek
government
 monitoring
 of
 imports
 if
 there
 is
 a
 reasonable
chance
 the
 industry
 would
 be
 harmed
 by
 an
 import
 surge.

 
 
 
 The
 full
 Ways
 and
 Means
 Committee
 is
 to
 consider
 the
 bill
next
 week
 and
 congressional
 sources
 said
 they
 expect
 it
 will
 be
approved.

 
 
 
 
 In
 investigations
 involving
 a
 processed
 agricultural
product,
 trade
 associations
 of
 processors
 or
 producers
 would
have
 to
 petition
 for
 relief
 from
 foreign
 dumping
 or
 unfair
duties.

 
 
 
 
 The
 bill
 sets
 out
 U.S.
 trade
 negotiating
 objectives
 for
the
 Uruguay
 round
 of
 talks
 under
 the
 General
 Agreement
 on
Tariffs
 and
 Trade.
 It
 would
 seek
 fair
 trade
 in
 agriculture,
seek
 to
 discipline
 restrictive
 or
 trade
 distorting
 import
 and
export
 practices,
 to
 eliminate
 tariffs,
 subsidies,
 quotas
 and
non-tariff
 barriers.

 
 
 
 
 President
 Reagan's
 authority
 to
 negotiate
 a
 new
 GATT
agreement
 would
 be
 extended
 through
 January
 1993
 and
 authority
to
 negotiate
 a
 free
 trade
 zone
 with
 Canada
 would
 be
 extended
through
 January
 3,
 1991.

 
 
 
 The
 bill
 extends
 Reagan's
 authority
 to
 negotiate
 an
international
 coffee
 agreement
 through
 October
 31,
 1989.

 
 
 
 It
 allows
 a
 refund
 of
 import
 duties
 paid
 on
 raw
 sugar
imported
 from
 November
 1,
 1977
 to
 March
 31,
 1985
 for
 production
of
 sugar
 or
 products
 containing
 sugar
 and
 destined
 for
re-export.
 The
 export
 of
 the
 sugar
 or
 products
 must
 occur
before
 Octoer
 1,
 1991.

 
 
 
 Presently,
 to
 qualify
 for
 the
 refund
 the
 sugar
 must
 be
processed
 within
 three
 years
 after
 import
 and
 exported
 within
five
 years.

 
 
 
 Agriculture
 would
 also
 benefit
 from
 more
 rapid
 decisions
 in
complaints
 of
 unfair
 foreign
 trade
 practices
 or
 injury
 from
imports.

 for

 used
in

 The

 added
 the

 would
 also
 worsen
 the

 stemming
 from
 the

<BODY>The

 (AWB)
1986/87
 export
 program
 is
 well
 advanced
 with
 over
 10
 mln
 tonnes
already
 sold,
 AWB
 general
 manager
 Ron
 Paice
 said.

 
 
 
 "We
 are
 certainly
 within
 reach
 of
 our
 15
 mln
 tonne
 export
target
 for
 the
 year,"
 he
 said
 in
 a
 statement.

 
 
 
 He
 did
 not
 detail
 the
 commitments
 already
 made,
 but
 an
 AWB
spokesman
 said
 they
 include
 sales
 to
 Egypt,
 China,
 Iran,
 the
Soviet
 Union
 and
 Iraq.

 
 
 
 In
 the
 1985/86
 wheat
 year
 ended
 September
 30,
 the
 AWB
exported
 a
 record
 15.96
 mln
 tonnes.

 
 
 
 Paice
 also
 said
 the
 1986/87
 Australian
 wheat
 harvest
 has
ended
 after
 a
 long,
 cool
 summer
 with
 15.14
 mln
 tonnes
 delivered
to
 the
 AWB.

 
 
 
 The
 season
 produced
 another
 good
 crop,
 with
 only
 0.2
 pct
 of
receivals
 being
 downgraded
 to
 feed
 quality,
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 However,
 it
 is
 likely
 that
 some
 weather-damaged
 grain
 was
still
 being
 held
 on
 farms
 and
 further
 milling
 and
 feed
 wheat
may
 be
 delivered
 following
 the
 recent
 announcement
 of
 the
 final
Guaranteed
 Minimum
 Price
 for
 1986/87,
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 Paice
 did
 not
 give
 a
 crop
 estimate,
 but
 the
 AWB's
 February
Wheat
 Australia
 publication
 put
 the
 crop
 at
 16.7
 mln
 tonnes.

 
 
 
 But
 the
 AWB
 spokesman
 said
 it
 is
 likely
 this
 estimate
 could
turn
 out
 to
 be
 too
 high,
 based
 on
 the
 receivals
 level,
 and
 the
final
 crop
 figure
 would
 probably
 be
 nearer
 to
 16.2
 mln
 tonnes.
The
 official
 estimate
 is
 not
 yet
 available.

 
 
 
 In
 the
 1985/86

 the

 received
 15.08

 of
the
 16.13

 a

 their
 collective

 rather
 than
 end
 their
13-day-old
 national
 strike
 on

 The
 seamen
 said
 they
 were
 spurred
 to
 their
 decision
 after
marines
 occupied
 the
 ship
 Docemarte
 in
 Santos
 harbour
 Tuesday
night.
 They
 said
 seamen
 on
 the
 vessel
 were
 being
 forced
 to
 work
under
 duress.

 
 
 
 President
 Jose
 Sarney's
 government
 despatched
 troops
 to
Brazil's
 ports
 and
 oil
 installations
 on
 Tuesday.

 
 
 
 Seamen
 in
 Santos,
 Brazil's
 main
 port,
 are
 in
 defiant
 mood.
One
 of
 their
 leaders,
 Orlando
 dos
 Santos,
 told
 Reuters
 that
most
 of
 the
 1,100
 seamen
 in
 the
 port
 offered
 their
 resignations
on
 Wednesday.
 The
 national
 strike
 headquarters
 in
 Rio
 de
Janeiro
 said
 seamen
 were
 offering
 to
 resign
 in
 all
 the
country's
 main
 ports.

 
 
 
 The
 strike
 by
 40,000
 seamen
 comes
 as
 Brazil
 faces
 a
 serious
debt
 crisis
 brought
 on
 by
 a
 sharp
 deterioration
 in
 its
 trade
balance.
 The
 country
 needs
 all
 the
 foreign
 exchange
 it
 can
 get,
and
 shipowners
 have
 been
 quick
 to
 denounce
 seamen
 for
 the
 harm
the
 strike
 is
 doing
 to
 exports.

 
 
 
 An
 advertisement
 placed
 in
 the
 newspapers
 by
 the
 Shipowners
Association
 read,
 "The
 seamen's
 strike
 is
 illegal,
 irrational
and
 unpatriotic."

 
 
 
 The
 seamen
 respond
 that
 they
 cannot
 live
 on
 their
 present
salaries.
 According
 to
 officical
 pay
 lists
 available
 in
 the
union's
 office,
 the
 basic
 pay
 for
 ordinary
 seamen
 is
 1,977
cruzados
 a
 month,
 while
 various
 allowances
 can
 bring
 their
total
 pay
 up
 to
 4,000
 cruzados
 a
 month.

 
 
 
 At
 the
 other
 end
 of
 the
 scale,
 captains
 earn
 7,993
 cruzados
a
 month
 basic
 pay,
 which
 is
 brought
 up
 to
 15,229
 cruzados
 with
allowances.
 

 
 
 
 "Brazil's
 seamen
 are
 the
 second
 worst
 paid
 in
 the
 world,
after
 Ghana's,"
 dos
 Santos
 said.
 He
 said
 the
 seamen
 had
 not
received
 a
 pay
 increase
 since
 February
 1986,
 and
 prices
 have
doubled
 since
 then
 with
 the
 collapse
 of
 the
 government's
Cruzado
 Plan
 price
 freeze.

 
 
 
 Talks
 in
 Rio
 de
 Janeiro
 Wednesday
 involving
 Labour
 Minister
Almir
 Pazzionotto,
 seamen
 and
 employers
 failed
 to
 resolve
 the
dispute.
 The

 are
 demanding
 pay
 raises
 of
 about
 200
 pct
but
 have
 been
 offered
 less
 than
 half
 that.

 shade

 this

 though
 it

 "I

 not
 above
 that,"
he

 Exports
 in

 were
 valued
 at

 U.S.
 Dlrs,
but
 the
 value
 could
 fall

 because

 production
 was

 plan
 target
of
 420,000
 tonnes
 for

 but
 Indonesia

 Renouf
 managing

 said
 in
 a
 statement
 it
had
 been
 Renouf's
 intention
 to
 build
 up
 a
 long-term
 strategic
position
 in
 NZI.
 "But
 it
 became
 clear
 to
 us
 that
 it
 was
 in
 the
best
 interests
 of
 both
 NZI
 and
 ourselves
 for
 Brierley
Investments
 to
 acquire
 our
 holding,"
 he
 said.

 
 
 
 He
 said
 Renouf
 built
 up
 its

 over
 the
 past
 six

 The
 sale
 comprised
 74.9

 at
 2.725

 Dlrs
 a

 and
 2,095

 at

 The

 are
 attached

 Each
 bond
 of
 5,000

 carries
 a

entitling
 the

 In
 its

 BIL
 reported
 that
 it
 held

 NZI.

 
 
 
 NZI

 is
 678.8

 Cashin
 said
 the

 will
 result
 in
 a
 significant

and
 places
 Renouf
 in
 a
 good

<BODY>Regie

 Renault
&lt;RENA.PA>
 said
 it
 and
 Chrysler
 Corp
 &lt;C>
 have
 signed
 a
 letter
 of
intent
 in
 which
 Chrysler
 plans
 to
 buy
 American
 Motors
 Corp
&lt;AMO.N>,
 46
 pct
 owned
 by
 Renault.

 
 
 
 Renault
 President
 Raymond
 Levy
 said
 in
 a
 statement
 issued
by
 the
 French
 state
 car
 group
 the
 agreement
 was
 an
 important
stage
 in
 Renault's
 redeployment.
 "It
 will
 allow
 Renault
 to
continue
 its
 export
 programme
 to
 the
 U.S.
 And
 also
 opens
 a
perspective
 of
 cooperation
 with
 a
 major
 American
 constructor,"
the
 statement
 said.
 Under
 the
 terms
 of
 the
 letter
 of
 intent,
Chrysler
 will
 purchase
 Renault's
 stake
 held
 in
 the
 form
 of
bonds
 and
 shares.

 
 
 
 The
 Renault
 statement
 quoted
 Chrysler
 Chairman
 Lee
 Iacocca
as
 saying,
 "We
 welcome
 AMC
 shareholders
 into
 the
 Chrysler
family."

 
 
 
 He
 added
 that
 the
 accord
 would
 allow
 Renault
 and
 Chrysler
to
 study
 the
 development
 of
 future
 products
 destined
 to
 be
distributed
 by
 Renault
 and
 Chrysler
 in
 the
 North
 American
 and
world
 markets.

 
 
 
 "Renault
 is
 a
 leader
 in
 our
 industry
 and
 I
 am
 happy
 to
 be
working
 with
 them,"
 Iacocca
 was
 quoted
 as
 saying.

 
 
 
 Chrysler
 will
 pay
 for
 Renault's
 AMC
 interests
 held
 in
 bonds
by
 a
 200
 mln
 dlr
 bond
 and
 will
 pay
 up
 to
 350
 mln
 dlrs
 for
Renault
 share
 interests,
 depending
 on
 AMC
 sales
 and
 future
profits,
 the
 Renault
 statement
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 statement
 said
 the
 agreement
 in
 principle
 gave
 each
side
 30
 days
 to
 put
 together
 a
 definitive
 accord.
 Approval
would
 also
 be
 necessary
 from
 the
 Renault,
 Chrysler
 and
 AMC
boards,
 from
 AMC
 shareholders
 and
 the
 relevant
 government
authorities.

 
 
 
 If
 the
 deal
 goes
 ahead,
 the
 statement
 said,
 AMC
shareholders
 other
 than
 Renault
 will
 receive
 Chrysler
 shares
for
 each
 of
 their
 shares
 valued
 at
 four
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 AMC
 shareholders
 with
 convertible
 preferential
 shares
 will
have
 the
 possibility
 to
 exchange
 them
 for
 Chrysler
 shares
 on
the
 same
 conditions
 as
 those
 they
 would
 have
 had
 in
 exchanging
them
 for
 AMC

 &lt;SO>
 TO
 TAKE
 CHARGE
 ON
 VOGTLE
 COST</TITLE>
<BODY>Southern
 Co
 said
 it
 will
 take
 an
after-tax
 charge
 of
 226
 mln
 dlrs
 against
 earnings
 no
 later
 than
January
 1988
 because
 the
 projected
 cost
 of
 the
 Vogtle
 nuclear
power
 plant
 has
 risen
 abover
 the
 amount
 which
 retail
 customers
in
 Georgia
 will
 be
 asked
 to
 pay.

 
 
 
 The
 company's
 largest
 subsidiary,
 Georgia
 Power
 Co,
 said
the
 budget
 for
 the
 plant
 has
 increased
 by
 6.3
 pct,
 or
 522
 mln
dlrs,
 to
 8.87
 billion.
 However,
 because
 of
 a
 pledge
 the
 made
last
 year
 to
 Georgia's
 Public
 Service
 Commission,
 the
 increased
cost
 will
 not
 be
 included
 in
 the
 utility's
 retail
 electric
rates.

 
 
 
 Geogia
 Power
 also
 said
 its
 board
 has
 delayed
 the
 scheduled
completion
 of
 Vogtle's
 Unit
 Two
 to
 June
 1989
 from
 September
1988.
 Unit
 Two
 is
 about
 60
 pct
 complete,
 it
 added.

 
 
 
 The
 utility
 said
 fuel
 loading
 has
 been
 completed
 at
 Unit
One
 and
 the
 unit
 is
 being
 put
 through
 a
 series
 of
 low-power
tests
 before
 the
 Nuclear
 Regulatory
 Commission
 is
 asked
 for
 a
full-power
 license.

 
 
 
 The
 nuclear
 power
 plant,
 located
 near
 Waynesboro,
 Ga.,
 is
co-owned
 by
 &lt;Oglethorpe
 Power
 Corp>,
 the
 Municipal
 Electric
Authority
 of
 Georgia
 and
 the
 city
 of
 Dalton.

 
 
 
 Georgia
 Power
 said
 the
 revised
 Vogtle
 budget
 estimate
 was
due
 to
 several
 factors,
 including
 additional
 labor
 costs
incurred
 to
 keep
 the
 plant's
 first
 unit
 on
 schedule
 for
commercial
 operation
 by
 June.
 The
 new
 figure
 represents
 the
first
 change
 in
 the
 plant's
 budget
 since
 August
 1985,
 when
 it
was
 estimated
 at
 8.35
 billion
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 In
 March
 1986,
 the
 utility
 told
 Georgia
 regulators
 it
 would
"cap"
 the
 price
 of
 Vogtle
 its
 customers
 would
 be
 asked
 to
 pay
at
 3.56
 billion
 dlrs,
 the
 company's
 share
 of
 the
 then
 projected
8.35
 billion
 dlr
 total.
 Under
 the
 new
 budget,
 Georgia
 Power
said,
 its
 share
 amounts
 to
 3.87
 billion
 dlrs.

 
 
 
 Noting
 that
 Georgia
 Power's
 share
 of
 the
 Vogtle
 increase
 is
313
 mln
 dlrs,
 Southern
 said
 this
 will
 result
 in
 a
 charge
against
 earnings
 of
 177
 mln
 dlrs
 after
 taxes.

 
 
 
 In
 addition,
 the
 company
 said,
 Georgia
 Power's
 contracts
with
 the
 joint
 owners
 require
 the
 utility
 to
 buy
 back
significant
 amounts
 of
 Vogtle
 capacity
 during
 the
 plant's
initial
 years
 of
 operation.
 Under
 terms
 of
 the
 cap
 on
 costs,
 it
will
 not
 attempt
 to
 recover
 the
 portion
 of
 the
 budget
 increase
that
 applies
 to
 the
 buybacks.

 
 
 
 This
 bings
 the
 total
 amount
 that
 must
 be
 charged
 against
earnings
 to
 2326
 mln
 dlrs
 after
 taxes,
 Southern
 said.

 
 
 
 Southern
 said
 new
 rules
 of
 the
 Financial
 Accounting
Standards
 Board,
 which
 are
 effective
 in
 January
 1988,
 require
any
 costs
 that
 are
 determined
 nonrecoverable
 to
 be
 charged
against
 earnings
 once
 that
 determination
 is
 made.

 
 
 
 The
 company
 also
 said
 its
 board
 has
 approved
 a
 capital
budget
 of
 2.1
 billion
 dlrs
 in
 1987,
 including
 work
 on
 the
Vogtle
 project.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 a
 5.9
 billion
 dlr
 capita
 budget
 for
 the
 three-year
period
 1987-1989
 was
 also
 outlined
 at
 the
 board
 meeting,
 noting
this
 is
 700
 mln
 dlrs
 below
 the
 comparable
 figure
 for
 the
 years
1986-1988.

 he
 refrained

 the

 the

 this

as

 from

 Brazil

 SLOWING
 IN

<BODY>The
 24
 nations
 of
 the
 Organisation
 for
Economic
 Cooperation
 and
 Development
 (OECD),
 hampered
 by
sluggish
 industrial
 output
 and
 trade,
 face
 slower
 economic
growth,
 and
 their
 joint
 balance
 of
 payments
 will
 swing
 into
deficit
 in
 1987,
 the
 Economist
 Intelligence
 Unit
 (EIU
 )
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 EIU
 said
 in
 its
 World
 Trade
 Forecast
 it
 revised
 OECD
economic
 growth
 downwards
 to
 2.5
 pct
 this
 year,
 compared
 with
 a
2.8
 pct
 growth
 forecast
 in
 December.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 the
 new
 areas
 of
 weakness
 are
 West
 Germany
 and
 the
smaller
 European
 countries
 it
 influences,
 and
 Japan,
 hardest
hit
 by
 currency
 appreciation
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 The
 independent
 research
 organisation
 cut
 its
 1987
 growth
rate
 forecasts
 for
 West
 Germany
 to
 2.2
 pct
 from
 3.2
 pct
 in
December
 and
 to
 2.3
 pct
 from
 three
 pct
 for
 Japan.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 it
 expected
 the
 OECD
 to
 post
 a
 current
 account
deficit
 of
 some
 13
 billion
 dlrs
 in
 both
 1987
 and
 1988,
 due
 in
large
 part
 to
 a
 1.50
 dlrs
 a
 barrel
 rise
 in
 1987
 oil
 prices.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 the
 U.S.
 Current
 account
 deficit
 looked
 likely
 to
fall
 even
 more
 slowly
 than
 forecast,
 to
 125
 billion
 dlrs
 in
1987
 and
 115
 billion
 in
 1988
 from
 130
 billion
 in
 1986.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 it
 expected
 West
 Germany
 to
 post
 a
 31
 billion
 dlr
payments
 surplus
 and
 Japan
 a
 76
 billion
 dlr
 surplus
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 The
 EIU
 said
 it
 saw
 oil
 prices
 dropping
 to
 around
 16.50
dlrs
 a
 barrel
 by
 end-1987
 and
 15.50
 dlrs
 in
 1988
 from
 about
 18
dlrs
 last
 year,
 as
 adherence
 to
 OPEC
 output
 policy
 becomes
increasingly
 ragged.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 the
 dollar
 is
 poised
 to
 resume
 its
 decline
 in
foreign
 exchange
 markets,
 and
 will
 lose
 a
 further
 13
 pct
 on
 its
trade-weighted
 index
 this
 year
 and
 five
 pct
 in
 1988
 after
 last
year's
 18.4
 pct
 drop.

 
 
 
 The
 average
 mark/dollar
 rate
 is
 put
 at
 1.80
 marks
 this
 year
and
 1.70
 in
 1988
 while
 the
 yen/dollar
 rate
 is
 expected
 to
 break
through
 the
 150
 yen
 barrier
 with
 an
 average
 value
 of
 150
 yen
 in
1987
 and
 146
 yen
 in
 1988,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 "This
 is
 not
 a
 crash
 scenario
 but
 the
 dollar's
 steeper
 angle
of
 descent
 increases
 the
 risk
 of
 ending
 with
 a
 fireball
 rather
than
 a
 three-point
 landing,"
 the
 EIU
 said.

 
 
 
 "Talking
 will
 not
 stop
 the
 dollar's
 slide
 for
 long
 and
 the
February
 meeting
 (of
 finance
 ministers
 of
 the
 Group
 of
 Five
 and
Canada)
 produced
 scant
 promise
 of
 either
 a
 decisive
 shift
 to
more
 expansive
 policies
 in
 West
 Germany
 and
 Japan,
 or
 a
 tighter
U.S.
 Fiscal
 policy,"
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 the
 key
 to
 the
 dollar's
 fortunes
 was
 the
willingness
 of
 Japanese
 institutions
 to
 buy
 U.S.
 Government
assets
 despite
 prospects
 of
 sustaining
 a
 currency
 loss.

 
 
 
 "Thus
 far
 they
 have
 been
 willing,"
 the
 EIC
 said,
 adding
 that
if
 Japan
 was
 deterred
 from
 buying
 U.S.
 Bonds
 the
 dollar
 would
collapse.

 
 
 
 To
 contain
 such
 a
 currency
 crisis,
 dollar
 interest
 rates
would
 have
 to
 soar,
 bringing
 recession
 and
 a
 Third
 World
 debt
crisis,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 On
 trade,
 the
 EIU
 said
 prospects
 for
 1987
 look
 "increasingly
sick."

 
 
 
 Import
 growth,
 forecast
 in
 December
 at
 4.5
 pct,
 is
 now
 seen
slowing
 down
 to
 around
 3.8
 pct
 in
 1987
 with
 a
 recovery
 only
 to
4.2
 pct
 in
 1988,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 weakness
 of
 the
 West
 German
 economy
 is
 the
 biggest
single
 factor,
 with
 import
 growth
 there
 expected
 to
 feature
 a
sluggish
 3.5
 pct
 growth
 in
 1987
 against
 the
 6.5
 pct
 forecast
 in
December,
 the
 EIU
 said.

 
 
 
 On
 the
 export
 side,
 it
 said
 it
 saw
 weak
 demand
 in
 West
Germany
 affecting
 export
 prospects
 elsewhere
 in
 Europe,
 while
Japan's
 exports
 in
 1987
 would
 remain
 flat
 and
 sales
 by
 U.S.
Exporters
 would
 respond
 only
 marginally
 to
 a
 lower,
 more
competitively-priced
 dollar.

 
 
 
 It
 said
 in
 most
 of
 Europe

<TITLE>BANKERS
 WELCOME
 SPANISH
 RESERVE
 REQUIREMENT
 HIKE</TITLE>
<BODY>Bankers
 welcomed
 the
 Bank
 of
 Spain's
decision
 to
 raise
 the
 reserve
 requirement
 for
 banks
 and
 savings
banks,
 saying
 it
 reflected
 the
 socialist
 government's
determination
 not
 to
 ease
 up
 in
 the
 fight
 against
 inflation
despite
 the
 painful
 social
 effects
 of
 four
 years
 of
 austerity.

 
 
 
 The
 central
 bank
 last
 night
 raised
 the
 requirement
 by
 one
percentage
 point
 to
 19
 pct
 from
 March
 13,
 saying
 that
 excess
liquidity
 threatened
 money
 supply
 and
 inflation
 targets.

 
 
 
 Bankers
 said
 the
 move
 represented
 a
 change
 of
 tactic
 by
 the
Bank,
 which
 until
 now
 has
 relied
 on
 raising
 interest
 rates
 to
choke
 off
 money
 supply
 growth.

 
 
 
 "I
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 measure,"
 a
 senior
 foreign
 banker
 said.
"It's
 a
 faster
 way
 to
 get
 the
 job
 done
 than
 using
 interest
 rates
and
 avoids
 unpleasant
 effects
 on
 other
 areas
 of
 the
 economy."

 
 
 
 "It
 shows
 that
 the
 political
 will
 is
 very
 strong.
 They
 know
that
 controlling
 inflation
 will
 make
 industry
 more
 competitive
and
 bring
 down
 unemployment
 in
 the
 long
 run,"
 he
 added.

 
 
 
 The
 head
 of
 another
 foreign
 bank
 said
 that
 only
 a
 month
ago,
 the
 Bank
 of
 Spain
 had
 dismissed
 his
 suggestion
 of
 a
 rise
in
 reserve
 requirements,
 preferring
 to
 pursue
 its
 strategy
 of
raising
 interest
 rates.

 
 
 
 But
 bankers
 said
 the
 high
 real
 interest
 rates
 on
 offer
 now
--
 around
 eight
 pct
 for
 overnight
 funds
 --
 was
 attracting
 money
from
 abroad,
 strengthening
 the
 peseta
 and
 making
 Spanish
exports
 less
 competitive.

 
 
 
 The
 government
 says
 industry's
 competitiveness
 is
 also
being
 hit
 hard
 by
 inflation.
 At
 8.3
 pct
 last
 year,
 the
 rate
 was
way
 above
 that
 of
 Spain's
 major
 trading
 partners
 in
 the
European
 Community,
 which
 it
 joined
 a
 year
 ago.

 
 
 
 To
 help
 meet
 this
 year's
 target
 of
 five
 pct,
 it
 is
insisting
 pay
 rises
 stay
 at
 that
 level,
 setting
 the
 stage
 for
clashes
 with
 trade
 unions,
 who
 say
 they
 have
 made
 enough
sacrifices.

 
 
 
 Demonstrations
 by
 workers,
 students
 and
 farmers,
 whose
demands
 essentially
 involve
 more
 government
 spending,
 have
become
 an
 almost
 daily
 occurrence.
 But
 Prime
 Minister
 Felipe
Gonzalez
 insists
 that
 the
 state
 is
 doing
 as
 much
 as
 it
 can.

 
 
 
 Bankers
 said
 the
 reserve
 requirement
 increase
 could
 have
some
 impact
 on
 commercial
 lending
 rates
 but
 should
 not
 hit
 the
money
 market
 too
 hard.

 
 
 
 The
 Bank
 of
 Spain,
 which
 only
 yesterday
 raised
 its
 key
overnight
 call
 money
 rate
 to
 13.5
 pct,
 left
 it
 unchanged
 at
today's
 auction.
 The
 rate
 has
 been
 increased
 nine
 times
 since
the
 start
 of
 the
 year,
 when
 it
 was
 below
 12
 pct.

 
 
 
 Bankers
 said
 commercial
 lending
 rates
 were
 set
 to
 rise
 in
any
 case
 with
 the
 end
 of
 the
 six
 pct
 maximium
 interest
 rate
banks
 can
 offer
 for
 time
 deposits
 of
 up
 to
 six
 months.

 
 
 
 The
 measure
 will
 take
 effect
 tomorrow,
 following
 the
publication
 of
 the
 decree
 in
 today's
 official
 gazette.
 Bankers
say
 the
 liberalisation
 will
 increase
 the
 cost
 of
 funds
 and,
inevitably,
 push
 lending
 rates
 higher.

 
 
 
 A
 companion
 measure,
 reducing
 the
 proportion
 of
 funds
 which
banks
 must
 invest
 in
 specific
 areas,
 also
 takes
 effect
tomorrow.
 Officials
 said
 when
 the
 cut
 was
 approved
 last
 month
that
 it
 was
 aimed
 partly
 at
 compensating
 banks
 for
 higher
interest
 rates.

<TITLE>EC
 DAIRY
 OUTPUT
 ACCORD
 PAVES
 WAY
 FOR
 MORE
 REFORM</TITLE>
<BODY>Officials
 and
 diplomats
 said
 EC
 farm
ministers,
 who
 earlier
 this
 week
 ended
 another
 marathon
negotiating
 session,
 achieved
 more
 than
 ever
 before
 in
 the
fight
 to
 end
 food
 surpluses,
 and
 delighted
 EC
 officials
 are
 now
preparing
 to
 carry
 the
 reform
 offensive
 into
 other
 areas.

 
 
 
 Their
 immediate
 aim
 is
 to
 drain
 the
 wine
 and
 olive
 oil
"lakes"
 and
 level
 the
 "grain
 mountain"
 that
 have
 brought
 the
Community
 so
 much
 unwelcome
 publicity.

 
 
 
 Earlier
 this
 week,
 ministers
 finally
 agreed
 after
 36
 hours
of
 negotiations
 the
 fine
 details
 of
 an
 outline
 accord
 to
 cut
milk
 output
 by
 9.5
 pct
 over
 two
 years
 and
 reduce
 butter
 stocks,
now
 at
 a
 record
 1.2
 mln
 tonnes.

 
 
 
 Officials
 said
 new
 rules,
 which
 place
 strict
 limits
 on
farmers'
 rights
 to
 benefit
 from
 high
 subsidised
 prices,
 could
be
 expected
 to
 reduce
 sales
 into
 intervention
 to
 a
 trickle
 and
pave
 the
 way
 for
 reform
 in
 other
 surplus
 sectors.

 
 
 
 The
 deal
 was
 reached
 despite
 determined
 attempts
 at
backsliding
 by
 some
 states
 as
 the
 implications
 of
 the
 original
outline
 accord
 reached
 last
 December
 began
 to
 sink
 in.

 
 
 
 "Despite
 coming
 under
 tremendous
 pressure,
 the
 ministers
never
 wavered
 from
 the
 main
 features
 of
 the
 deal,"
 one
 senior
official
 said,
 adding
 the
 result
 augured
 well
 for
 talks
 later
this
 month
 on
 other
 reforms.

 
 
 
 The
 Commission
 is
 leading
 the
 fight
 against
 food
 surpluses
and
 has
 now
 proposed
 the
 most
 severe
 annual
 price
 review,
 at
which
 ministers
 fix
 farm
 support
 prices,
 in
 the
 EC's
 history.

 
 
 
 Most
 prices
 would
 be
 cut
 or
 frozen,
 new
 quality
 standards
enforced,
 and
 most
 farmers'
 rights
 to
 sell
 to
 intervention
curtailed.
 Officials
 say
 the
 measures
 could
 lead
 to
 effective
price
 cuts
 for
 some
 low
 quality
 cereals
 of
 eight
 to
 11
 pct.

 
 
 
 EC
 Commissioner
 Frans
 Andriessen
 is
 currently
 working
 on
proposals
 to
 provide
 direct
 income
 aids
 to
 farmers
 to
 cushion
them
 from
 the
 worst
 effects
 of
 a
 restrictive
 price
 policy
 and
encourage
 ministers
 to
 swallow
 the
 reform
 pill.

 called
 for

 of
 American
 Telephone

Telegraph
 Co.,
 its
 principal
 competitor.

 
 
 
 MCI
 said
 it
 will
 ask
 the
 Federal
 Communications
 Commission
tomarrow
 to
 deregulate
 ATT
 in
 order
 to
 let
 marketplace
 forces
govern
 the
 long
 distance
 telephone
 market.

 
 
 
 "It's
 time
 to
 let
 the
 market
 manage
 ATT,"
 MCI
 president
 Bert
Roberts
 told
 a
 news
 briefing
 here.

 
 
 
 MCI
 has
 seen
 its
 profits
 shaved
 recently
 by
 ATT
 long
distance
 rate
 reductions
 ordered
 by
 the
 FCC
 following
 the
breakup
 of
 the
 Bell
 System.

 
 
 
 The
 MCI
 move
 signals
 its
 belief
 that
 ATT
 may
 raise
 profits
rather
 than
 cut
 rates
 if
 deregulated.

 
 
 
 To
 allay
 consumers'
 fears
 that
 deregulation
 might
 lead
 to
price
 increases,
 Roberts
 said
 one
 alternative
 open
 to
 the
 FCC
would
 be
 adoption
 of
 a
 transitional
 "price
 cap"
 concept.

 
 
 
 Roberts
 noted
 that
 such
 a
 plan
 is
 backed
 by
 FCC
commissioner
 Dennis
 Patrick,
 whose
 is
 widely
 expected
 to
 be
named
 FCC
 chairman.

 
 
 
 Roberts
 conceded
 that
 ATT's
 deregulation
 posed
 risks
 to
MCI.

 
 
 
 "The
 greater
 risk,
 however,
 is
 continuing
 the
 artificial
market
 environment
 created
 by
 piecemeal
 FCC
 deregulation
 of
ATT."

 producers,"
 Sen.
 Don
 Nickles,
 an
 Oklahoma
Republican,
 said
 in
 a
 letter
 to
 fellow
 senators
 seeking
 support
for
 his
 legislation
 to
 limit
 these
 loans.

 
 
 
 Nickles
 and
 Sen.
 Steven
 Symms,
 a
 conservative
 Republican
from
 Idaho,
 have
 introduced
 legislation
 that
 would
 strictly
limit
 U.S.
 funding
 of
 multinational
 development
 banks
 if
 they
make
 any
 loans
 to
 help
 developing
 countries
 produce
 surplus
commodities
 or
 minerals.

 
 
 
 Current
 law
 requires
 the
 United
 States
 to
 vote
 against
 such
loans
 but
 carries
 no
 reprisals
 if
 they
 pass
 anyway.

 
 
 
 Treasury
 Secretary
 James
 Baker's
 assurances
 that
 U.S.
policy
 is
 to
 oppose
 these
 loans
 did
 not
 satisfy
 concerns
 raised
at
 two
 Senate
 committee
 hearings
 last
 week.

 
 
 
 Baker
 told
 a
 Senate
 Appropriations
 subcommittee
 on
 Foreign
Operations,
 "as
 a
 policy
 matter,
 we
 oppose
 loans
 for
 production
of
 commodities
 in
 oversupply."

 
 
 
 The
 senators
 cited
 a
 350
 mln
 dlr
 World
 Bank
 loan
 made
 to
Argentina
 last
 year
 to
 help
 it
 increase
 its
 agricultural
exports
 by
 one
 billion
 dlrs
 a
 year
 by
 1989.

 
 
 
 Nickles,
 Symms
 and
 others
 also
 have
 cited
 other
 loans
 such
as
 a
 1985
 World
 Bank
 loan
 to
 Hungary
 to
 expand
 livestock
exports
 and
 500
 mln
 dlrs
 lent
 to
 Thailand
 from
 1981
 to
 1985
 at
low
 interest
 rates
 for
 agriculture.
 Baker
 said
 the
 Argentine
loan
 was
 "really
 the
 only
 one
 you
 can
 point
 to
 and
 criticize."

 
 
 
 Last
 year
 the
 Republican-controlled
 Senate
 voted
 three
times
 over
 the
 objections
 of
 the
 administration
 to
 cut
 U.S.
funding
 of
 development
 banks
 by
 the
 amount
 of
 these
 loans.

 
 
 
 Even
 with
 a
 favorable
 vote
 of
 65
 to
 15,
 the
 restrictions
were
 weakened
 in
 the
 final
 version.
 Only
 a
 provision
 directing
U.S.
 officials
 to
 vote
 disapproval
 was
 enacted
 into
 law.

 
 
 
 This
 year's
 proposal,
 called
 the
 Foreign
 Agricultural
Investment
 Reform
 (FAIR)
 Act
 would
 require
 the
 U.S.
 to
 vote
against
 loans
 designed
 to
 increase
 production
 of
 surplus
commodities
 and
 minerals.

 
 
 
 Also,
 the
 recipient
 countries
 would
 have
 to
 prove
 that
 the
production,
 marketing
 and
 export
 of
 the
 commodities
 could
 be
handled
 without
 government
 subsidy.

 
 
 
 If
 the
 loan
 is
 approved
 over
 U.S.
 objections,
 the
 United
States
 would
 not
 increase
 or
 replenish
 funds
 for
 that
institution
 until
 it
 agrees
 to
 stop
 making
 such
 loans.

 
 
 
 Objections
 to
 such
 loans
 have
 most
 often
 been
 raised
 by
conservative
 Republicans
 who
 have
 traditionally
 opposed
 U.S.
funding
 for
 these
 international
 development
 banks.

 
 
 
 But
 the
 loss
 of
 many
 jobs
 to
 foreign
 competition
 has
 raised
similar
 concerns
 among
 more
 moderate
 senators.

 
 
 
 Democratic
 senator
 Barbara
 Mikulski
 of
 Maryland
 told
 Baker
at
 the
 Senate
 Appropriations
 subcommittee
 hearing,
 "Many
 say
 the
banks
 are
 financing
 competition
 for
 American
 jobs."

 
 
 
 She
 recommended
 that
 the
 United
 States
 use
 its
participation
 in
 debt
 forgiveness
 for
 developing
 country
 loans
as
 a
 wedge
 to
 open
 markets
 to
 U.S.
 goods.

 
 
 
 The
 administration
 opposes
 any
 legislation
 that
 would
 tie
its
 hands
 in
 votes
 on
 the
 loans.
 It
 argues
 there
 might
 be
instances
 in
 which
 a
 country
 needed
 the
 money
 to
 continue
 its
moves
 toward
 U.S.
 policies
 in
 other
 areas.

 
 
 
 Baker
 said
 the
 United
 States
 would
 continue
 to
 use
 its
leverage
 in
 the
 banks
 to
 require
 foreign
 trade
 liberalization
measures,
 often
 in
 the
 form
 of
 elimination
 of
 subsidies.

 increased
 by
 nearly
 64,000

 over
 the
 country's
 suspension
 of
 interest
payments,
 according
 to
 a
 telex
 from
 committee
 chairman
 Citibank
to
 creditor
 banks
 worldwide.

 
 
 
 Bankers
 said
 the
 diplomatic
 phrase
 belied
 the
 deep
 anger
and
 frustration
 on
 the
 committee
 over
 Brazil's
 unilateral
 move
last
 Friday
 and
 its
 subsequent
 freeze
 on
 some
 15

of
 short-term

 UNLIKELY

<BODY>Liquefied
 natural

 imports
 from
Algeria
 are
 unlikely
 to
 happen
 in
 1987
 even
 though
 its
economically
 feasible,
 U.S.
 industry
 analysts
 sources
 said.

 
 
 
 Youcef
 Yousfi,
 director-general
 of
 Sonatrach,
 the
 Algerian
state
 petroleum
 agency,
 indicated
 in
 a
 television
 interview
 in
Algiers
 that
 such
 imports
 would
 be
 made
 this
 year.

 
 
 
 "Contract
 negotiations,
 filing
 with
 the
 U.S.
 government
 and
the
 time
 required
 to
 restart
 mothballed
 terminals
 will
 delay
the
 import
 until
 1988/1989,"
 Daniel
 Tulis,
 a
 natural
 gas
analyst
 with
 Shearson
 Lehman
 Bros.
 said.

 
 
 
 Sonatrach
 is
 currently
 negotiating
 with
 two
 of
 its
 former
customers,
 Panhandle
 Eastern
 &lt;PEL>
 and
 Distrigas,
 a
 subsidiary
of
 Cabot
 Corp
 &lt;CBT>
 to
 resume
 LNG
 export,
 company
 officials
told
 Reuters.
 A
 third,
 El
 Paso
 Gas,
 a
 subsidiary
 of
 Burlington
Northern
 &lt;BNI>,
 has
 expressed
 no
 interest.

 
 
 
 Industry
 analysts
 said
 some
 imports
 of
 Algerian
 LNG
 were
feasible.
 "On
 a
 marginal
 cost
 basis,
 the
 companies
 that
 have
made
 capital
 investment
 to
 handle
 LNG
 import
 can
 operate
profitably
 even
 in
 the
 current
 price
 environment,"
 
 Frank
Spadine,
 an
 energy
 economist
 with
 Bankers
 Trust,
 said.

 
 
 Analysts
 did
 not
 forsee
 a
 major
 impact
 from
 Algerian
 imports
on
 U.S.
 prices
 which
 are
 currently
 soft
 but
 expected
 to
 trend
higher
 by
 the
 end
 of
 1987.

 
 
 
 A
 decline
 in
 gas
 drilling
 and
 the
 time
 lag
 to
 bring
 Gulf
 of
Mexico
 productions
 onstream
 will
 tighten
 gas
 supplies
 and
 firm
prices,
 Shearson's
 Tulis
 said.

 
 
 In
 this
 context,
 Algerian
 LNG
 import
 would
 be
 a
 source
 of
supplemental
 supply
 to
 U.S.
 domestic
 production,
 he
 added.

 
 
 
 Company
 sources
 currently
 in
 talks
 with
 Algeria
 agree,
saying
 that
 Algerian
 LNG
 would
 only
 serve
 to
 meet
 peak
 demand.

 
 
 
 Company
 sources
 also
 said
 that
 any
 negotiations
 with
Algeria
 would
 emphasize
 looser
 arrangements
 which
 would
 relate
volumes
 to
 market
 requirements
 and
 prices
 to
 U.S.
 spot

values.

 FARM

 RESCUE
 BILL
 SEEN
 BEFORE

<BODY>The
 chairman
 of
 the
 Senate
 Agriculture
subcommittee
 on
 credit
 said
 the
 panel
 will
 consider
 a
 farm
credit
 rescue
 package
 by
 Easter
 even
 if
 the
 system
 and
 its
regulator
 do
 not
 ask
 for
 help
 by
 then.

 
 
 
 "We're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 bill
 to
 markup,
 I
 guarantee
 you,
before
 the
 Easter
 recess,"
 Sen.
 David
 Boren
 (D-Okla.)
 said.

 
 
 
 Senate
 Majority
 leader
 Robert
 Byrd
 (D-W.Va.)
 wants
recommendations
 on
 farm
 credit
 presented
 by
 April
 11,
 when
Congress
 is
 scheduled
 to
 break
 for
 Easter,
 Boren
 said.

 
 
 
 Boren
 urged
 the
 Farm
 Credit
 Administration
 (FCA),
 the
system's
 regulator,
 to
 quickly
 make
 a
 formal
 request
 for
 aid.

 
 
 
 Under
 the
 1985
 Farm
 credit
 law
 passed
 by
 Congress,
 the
 FCA,
as
 regulator,
 is
 to
 certify
 when
 the
 system
 has
 exhausted
 all
its
 capital
 and
 needs
 federal
 government
 help.

 
 
 
 However,
 FCA
 chairman
 Frank
 Naylor
 said
 because
 much
 of
 the
system's
 remaining
 capital
 is
 tied-up
 in
 legal
 action,
he
 could
 not
 technically
 certify
 a
 rescue
 is
 needed
 this
 year
and
 perhaps
 not
 even
 in
 1988.
 The
 other
 Republican
 member
 of
the
 three-man
 FCA
 board,
 Marvin
 Duncan,
 agreed.

 
 
 
 But
 Boren
 urged
 that
 even
 if
 FCA
 cannot
 technically
 certify
aid
 is
 needed,
 it
 should
 request
 help
 informally.

 
 
 
 "We
 all
 know
 we
 need
 a
 capital
 infusion,"
 Boren
 said.

 
 
 
 Boren
 and
 the
 FCA
 officials
 spoke
 at
 a
 hearing
 on
 the
plight
 of
 the
 farm
 credit
 system.
 Also
 at
 the
 hearing,
 Brent
Beesely,
 chief
 executive
 of
 the
 Farm
 Credit
 Council
representing
 the
 system,
 said
 that
 at
 the
 end
 of
 1986
 the
system
 had
 only
 1.5
 billion
 dlrs
 in
 working
 capital
 remaining
after
 losses
 of
 4.6
 billion
 dlrs
 over
 the
 last
 two
 years.

 
 
 
 While
 he
 did
 not
 ask
 for
 government
 aid,
 Beesley
 indicated
the
 situation
 is
 serious
 in
 some
 of
 the
 12
 system
 districts.

 
 
 
 "A
 significant
 number
 of
 banks
 and
 associations
 in
 the
 most
economically
 depressed
 areas
 have
 and
 will
 continue
 to
 suffer
extraordinary
 losses,"
 Beesley
 said.

 
 
 
 Jim
 Billington,
 Democratic
 member
 of
 the
 FCA
 board,
 said
the
 troubles
 of
 the
 system
 have
 encouraged
 the
 flight
 of
 some
one
 billion
 dlrs
 per
 month
 from
 the
 system
 as
 borrowers
 repay
loans.

 
 
 
 The
 system's
 total
 portfolio
 shrank
 to
 54.6
 billion
 dlrs
 by
the
 end
 of
 last
 year
 from
 66.6
 billion
 the
 previous
 year.

 
 
 
 FCA
 board
 members
 said
 both
 borrowers
 and
 holders
 of
 bonds
in
 the
 system
 need
 to
 be
 assured
 their
 money
 is
 safe.
 Naylor
suggested
 the
 need
 for
 a
 federal
 assurance
 to
 bondholders.

 
 
 
 "The
 bondholders
 have
 no
 worry
 at
 this
 time,"
 Billington
said.

 
 
 
 Naylor
 said
 several
 proposals
 for
 revamping
 the
 farm
 credit
system
 are
 circulating.
 The
 proposals
 range
 from
 consolidation
of
 the
 system
 into
 a
 centralized
 national
 lender,
 to
de-centralizing
 into
 semi-independent
 institutions.

 
 
 
 But
 He
 and
 the
 system
 spokesman
 Beesley
 were
 cautious
 about
proposals
 for
 a
 secondary
 market
 on
 farm
 loans.
 Those
proposals
 would
 package
 farm
 loans
 for
 resale
 to
 investors.

 
 
 
 Naylor
 and
 Beesley
 said
 a
 secondary
 market
 set-up
 outside
the
 farm
 credit
 system
 would
 hurt
 the
 system.
 But
 Beesley
 said
a
 secondary
 market
 with
 the
 farm
 credit
 system
 as
 its
 agent
could
 be
 developed
 without
 Congressional
 legislation.

<TITLE>REPORT
 COULD
 BE
 FINAL
 BLOW
 FOR
 REGAN</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 Tower
 Commission's
 scathing
 
 
 
comments
 on
 President
 Reagan's
 embattled
 chief
 of
 staff
 Donald
Regan
 could
 signal
 the
 death
 knell
 to
 his
 White
 House
 tenure,
but
 the
 impact
 of
 its
 strong
 criticism
 on
 two
 other
 top
officials
 was
 less
 clear.

 
 
 
 Regan
 has
 come
 in
 for
 tough
 criticism
 for
 his
 handling
 of
Reagan's
 worst
 political
 crisis
 since
 details
 of
 the
 covert
arms
 sales
 to
 Iran
 and
 diversion
 of
 profits
 to
 Nicaraguan
rebels
 first
 emerged
 last
 November.

 
 
 
 But
 criticism
 of
 the
 roles
 of
 Secretary
 of
 State
 George
Shultz
 and
 Defense
 Secretary
 Caspar
 Weinberger,
 who
 said
 they
opposed
 the
 Iran
 arms
 initiative
 yet
 failed
 to
 end
 it,
 had
 been
muted
 until
 the
 release
 of
 the
 Tower
 Commission
 report.

 
 
 
 "Their
 obligation
 was
 to
 give
 the
 president
 their
 full
support
 and
 continued
 advice
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 program
 or,
 if
they
 could
 not
 in
 conscience
 do
 that,
 to
 so
 inform
 the
president,"
 the
 report
 said
 after
 a
 three-month
 probe.

 
 
 
 "Instead,
 they
 simply
 distanced
 themselves
 from
 the
 program.
They
 protected
 the
 record
 as
 to
 their
 own
 positions
 on
 this
issue.
 They
 were
 not
 energetic
 in
 attempting
 to
 protect
 the
president
 from
 the
 consequences
 of
 his
 personal
 commitment
 to
freeing
 the
 hostages."

 
 
 
 The
 report
 saved
 some
 of
 its
 most
 scathing
 language
 for
Regan,
 a
 gruff
 former
 Wall
 Street
 executive
 and
 close
 personal
friend
 of
 Reagan
 whose
 autocratic
 rule
 in
 the
 White
 House
angered
 some
 top
 Reagan
 officials
 and,
 perhaps
 more
importantly,
 Reagan's
 wife
 Nancy.

 
 
 
 "More
 than
 almost
 any
 chief
 of
 staff
 of
 recent
 memory,
 he
asserted
 personal
 control
 over
 the
 White
 House
 staff
 and
 sought
to
 extend
 this
 control
 to
 the
 national
 security
 adviser,"
 said
the
 report.

 
 
 
 Washington
 analysts
 said
 Regan's
 departure
 now
 appeared
 to
be
 only
 a
 matter
 of
 timing.
 Many
 expected
 the
 president
 to
announce
 it
 when
 he
 addresses
 the
 nation
 on
 the
 Tower
Commission's
 findings
 next
 week.

 
 
 
 With
 Regan's
 departure
 apparently
 imminent
 and
 Poindexter
and
 other
 key
 figures
 in
 the
 scandal
 already
 out
 of
 office,
 the
report's
 tough
 criticism
 of
 Shultz
 and
 Weinberger
 could
 turn
the
 spotlight
 on
 their
 future.

 
 
 
 Senate
 Republican
 leader
 Robert
 Dole,
 a
 key
 Reagan
 ally,
told
 reporters
 the
 report
 disclosed
 "colossal
 blunders"
 and
 said
people
 who
 had
 not
 served
 the
 president
 well
 should
 step
 aside,
but
 he
 did
 not
 specify
 who
 should
 go.

 
 
 
 "It
 would
 seem
 to
 me
 that
 if
 you
 don't
 protect
 the
president,
 you
 don't
 serve
 the
 president
 well,
 then
 you
 should
move
 on,"
 the
 Kansas
 Republican,
 a
 likely
 presidential
 candidate
next
 year,
 said.

 
 
 
 One
 Republican
 strategist
 said
 he
 believed
 Regan
 would
 not
be
 the
 only
 White
 House
 official
 to
 leave
 in
 the
 near
 future.

<TITLE>SWISS
 ECONOMY
 IN
 EXCELLENT
 CONDITION,
 OECD
 SAYS</TITLE>
<BODY>Switzerland's
 economy,
 combining
 low
unemployment,
 financial
 stability
 and
 a
 large
 external
 payments
surplus,
 is
 in
 excellent
 condition
 and
 faces
 a
 satisfactory
future,
 the
 Organisation
 for
 Economic
 Cooperation
 and
Development,
 OECD,
 said.

 
 
 
 This
 reflected
 the
 success
 of
 stable
 and
 relatively
 tight
fiscal
 and
 monetary
 policies
 followed
 by
 the
 government,
 it
said.

 
 
 
 The
 OECD,
 in
 its
 annual
 report
 on
 Switzerland,
 picked
 out
some
 signs
 of
 a
 slowdown
 in
 activity
 and
 a
 slight
 pick-up
 in
inflation
 this
 year,
 but
 said
 these
 gave
 no
 cause
 for
 concern.

 
 
 
 The
 study
 forecast
 a
 decline
 in
 Gross
 Domestic
 Product
growth
 to
 1.75
 pct
 this
 year
 from
 an
 estimated
 two
 pct
 in
 1986
and
 a
 small
 rise
 in
 consumer
 price
 inflation
 to
 1.25
 pct
 after
last
 year's
 sharp
 fall
 to
 0.75
 pct
 from
 3.6
 pct
 in
 1985.

 
 
 
 But
 it
 said
 job
 creation
 should
 continue
 to
 absorb
 a
 modest
increase
 in
 the
 workforce,
 leaving
 the
 unemployment
 rate
unchanged
 at
 around
 one
 pct,
 the
 lowest
 in
 the
 24-industrial
nation
 OECD
 area.

 
 
 
 Assuming
 an
 average
 exchange
 rate
 of
 1.71
 Swiss
 francs
 to
the
 dollar
 this
 year,
 against
 1.69
 in
 the
 second
 half
 of
 1986,
the
 report
 forecast
 a
 2.75
 pct
 rise
 in
 exports
 and
 a
 3.5
 pct
rise
 in
 imports
 this
 year
 after
 rises
 of
 3.25
 pct
 and
 6.5
 pct
respectively
 in
 1986.

 
 
 
 The
 faster
 growth
 of
 imports
 compared
 with
 exports
 this
year
 and
 last,
 reflecting
 buoyant
 private
 consumption,
 meant
that
 the
 contribution
 of
 the
 foreign
 payments
 balance
 to
 GDP
would
 shrink
 in
 both
 years.

 
 
 
 But
 "given
 Switzerland's
 large
 external
 surplus,
 there
should
 be
 no
 concern
 if
 domestic
 demand
 grows
 faster
 than
GDP...Which,
 if
 only
 in
 a
 small
 way,
 would
 contribute
 to
improving
 international
 balances,"
 the
 OECD
 said.

 
 
 
 Real
 private
 consumption
 appeared
 to
 have
 been
 unusually
buoyant
 last
 year,
 with
 a
 3.25
 pct
 growth
 rate,
 after
 several
years
 of
 relative
 weakness,
 it
 noted.

 
 
 
 In
 1987
 private
 consumption
 was
 expected
 to
 slow
 somewhat
to
 a
 2.25
 pct
 growth
 rate,
 but
 should
 still
 outstrip
 overall
GDP,
 it
 added.

 
 
 
 The
 outlook
 for
 investment
 in
 plant
 and
 machinery
 remained
bright
 into
 1987,
 and
 with
 capacity
 use
 at
 near
 record
 levels
last
 year
 there
 was
 scope
 for
 rationalisation
 and
 modernisation
in
 both
 the
 industry
 and
 service
 sectors,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 As
 a
 consequence,
 growth
 in
 machinery
 and
 equipment
investment
 is
 likely
 to
 decelerate
 only
 slightly
 this
 year
after
 vigorous
 growth
 in
 1986.

 
 
 
 But
 the
 report
 raised
 a
 questionmark
 over
 the
 prospects
 for
tourism
 and
 the
 banking
 industry,
 two
 major
 service
 sector
earners
 of
 foreign
 exchange.

 
 
 
 The
 long-term
 appreciation
 of
 the
 Swiss
 Franc,
 and
 the
accelerating
 deregulation
 of
 foreign
 banking
 markets,
 could
lead
 to
 a
 loss
 of
 international
 market
 share
 for
 both,
 it
 said.

 
 
 
 Particularly
 for
 the
 banks,
 "recent
 developments
 in
international
 financial
 markets
 give
 rise
 to
 the
 question
whether
 the
 Swiss
 financial
 system,
 which
 has
 shown
 substantial
flexibility
 in
 the
 past,
 is
 adapting
 itself
 at
 the
 speed
required
 ...
 To
 preserve
 its
 competitive
 position,"
 it
 said.

<TITLE>U.S.
 WHEAT
 BONUS
 TO
 SOVIET
 CALLED
 DORMANT</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 U.S.
 Agriculture
 Department
 is
 not
actively
 considering
 offering
 subsidized
 wheat
 to
 the
 Soviet
Union
 under
 the
 export
 enhancement
 program
 (EEP),
 senior
 USDA
officials
 said.

 
 
 
 However,
 grain
 trade
 analysts
 said
 the
 proposal
 has
 not
been
 ruled
 out
 and
 that
 an
 offer
 might
 be
 made,
 though
 not
 in
the
 very
 near
 future.

 
 
 
 "The
 grain
 companies
 are
 trying
 to
 get
 this
 fired
 up
 again,"
an
 aide
 to
 Agriculture
 Secretary
 Richard
 Lyng
 said.
 "But
 there
just
 isn't
 much
 talk
 about
 it,
 informally
 or
 formally."

 
 
 
 Most
 analysts
 interviewed
 by
 Reuters
 were
 more
 confident
than
 USDA
 officials
 that
 bonus
 wheat
 would
 be
 offered
 to
 the
Soviets,
 even
 though
 U.S.
 officials
 did
 not
 make
 such
 an
 offer
when
 they
 held
 grain
 talks
 with
 Soviet
 counterparts
 earlier
this
 week.

 
 
 
 But
 administration
 and
 private
 sources
 agreed
 that
 if
 the
Reagan
 administration
 did
 decide
 to
 offer
 subsidized
 wheat
 to
Moscow,
 it
 could
 take
 several
 months.

 
 
 
 "I
 just
 don't
 see
 any
 proposal
 like
 that
 sailing
 through
 any
interagency
 process,"
 the
 aide
 to
 Lyng
 said.

 
 
 
 "An
 export
 enhancement
 offer
 is
 not
 consummated
 overnight,"
said
 one
 former
 USDA
 official,
 who
 noted
 that
 the
administration
 took
 three
 months
 to
 decide
 in
 favor
 of
 selling
China
 wheat
 under
 the
 subsidy
 program.

 
 
 
 An
 official
 representing
 a
 large
 grain
 trade
 company
 said
deliberations
 within
 USDA
 might
 be
 nudged
 along
 by
 members
 of
Congress,
 a
 number
 of
 whom
 urged
 USDA
 this
 week
 to
 make
 a
 wheat
subsidy
 offer
 to
 the
 Soviets.

 
 
 
 But
 Lyng's
 aide
 said
 that
 during
 a
 day-long
 visit
 to
Capitol
 Hill
 yesterday,
 House
 members
 did
 not
 press
 the
secretary
 on
 the
 subsidy
 question
 a
 single
 time.

 
 
 
 The
 administration's
 interagency
 trade
 policy
 review
 group,
comprised
 of
 subcabinet-level
 officials,
 has
 not
 been
 asked
 to
clear
 a
 request
 to
 offer
 Moscow
 wheat
 under
 the
 EEP,
 officials
at
 the
 U.S.
 Trade
 Representative's
 Office
 said.

 
 
 
 In
 their
 talks
 this
 week,
 the
 two
 sides
 discussed
 the
administration's
 previous
 EEP
 offer
 but
 did
 not
 talk
 about
 any
new
 initiative.
 One
 USDA
 official
 who
 took
 part
 in
 the
consultations
 this
 week
 described
 them
 as
 an
 exchange
 of
 "calm,
basic,
 factual
 economics."

 
 
 
 Another
 USDA
 official
 said
 there
 was
 "not
 even
 an
 informal
suggestion
 or
 hint"
 that
 the
 Soviets
 would
 live
 up
 to
 their
pledge
 to
 buy
 four
 mln
 tonnes
 of
 wheat
 this
 year
 if
 they
 were
granted
 more
 favorable
 terms.

 
 
 
 USDA
 and
 private
 sources
 agreed
 that
 consideration
 of
 an
EEP
 initiative
 by
 interagency
 review
 groups
 likely
 would
 be
delayed
 because
 of
 disarray
 within
 the
 White
 House
 stemming
from
 the
 Iran
 arms
 affair.

<TITLE>U.S.

 PART

 ARGENTINE
 BRIDGE
 LOAN</TITLE>
<BODY>The
 U.S.
 Treasury
 said
 it
 was
 willing
to
 participate
 with
 several
 other
 industrial
 countries
 in
providing
 a
 500
 mln-dlr
 short-term
 bridge
 loan
 to
 Argentina.

 
 
 
 The
 Treasury
 announcecement
 did
 not
 name
 the
 other
countries
 nor
 the
 amount
 of
 financing
 the
 United
 States
 was
willing
 to
 supply.

 
 
 
 Argentina
 announced
 a
 wage
 and
 price
 freeze
 on
 Wednesday
night
 and
 is
 negotiating
 with
 New
 York
 bankers
 for
 about
 2.15
billion
 dlrs
 in
 new
 loans
 and
 other
 financing.

 
 
 
 "Our
 willingness
 to
 participate
 in
 this
 multilateral
short-term
 financing
 indicates
 our
 support
 for
 Argentina's
economic
 program
 to
 achieve
 sustainable
 growth
 and
 a
 viable
balance
 of
 payments
 position,"
 the
 Treassury
 statement
 said.

 
 
 
 In
 announcing
 a
 four-month
 wage
 and
 price
 freeze,
 Argentine
officials
 said
 the
 country
 needed
 "a
 more
 serene
 climate"
 to
carry
 out
 structural
 changes
 in
 the
 economy.

 
 
 
 But
 Argentina
 did
 not
 suspend
 interest
 payments
 on
 its
foreign
 debts,
 as
 neighboring
 Brazil
 did
 last
 week.

 
 
 
 The
 Treasury
 said
 the
 U.S.
 share
 of
 bridge
 financing
 for
Argentina
 would
 come
 from
 its
 Exchange
 Stabilization
 Fund.

 
 
 
 The
 one-page
 statement
 noted
 the
 International
 Monetary
Fund
 expressed
 confidence
 in
 Argentina's
 economic
 policies
 and
prospects
 by
 approving
 a
 new
 stand-by
 financing
 arrangement
 for
it
 on
 February
 18.

 
 
 
 "Argentina
 is
 expected
 to
 qualify
 for
 IMF
balance-of-payments
 financing
 which
 would
 enable
 Argentina
 to
repay
 a
 multilateral
 bridge
 loan
 and
 support
 the
 implementation
of
 its
 economic
 program,"
 the
 statement
 said.

 
 
 
 The
 latest
 Argentine
 action
 marked
 the
 second
 time
 in
 less
than
 two
 years
 its
 government
 has
 used
 a
 wage
 and
 price
 freeze
to
 restrain
 inflation.

 
 
 
 The
 debt
 talks
 in
 New
 York
 are
 being
 headed
 by
 Argentine
Finance
 Minister
 Mario
 Brodersohn
 and
 are
 expected
 to
 last
 for
several
 days.

 
 
 
 Along
 with
 new
 financing,
 Argentina
 reportedly
 wants
 lower
interest
 rates
 on
 an
 existing
 total
 53
 billion
 dlrs
 in
 foreign
debt
 and
 elimination
 of
 foreign
